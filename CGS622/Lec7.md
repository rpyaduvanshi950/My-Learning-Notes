## üß† Lecture Theme: *Language Acquisition in Bi/Multilinguals ‚Äì III*

### **Focus: How infants perceive and learn sounds (phonemes) when they are exposed to one or more languages.**

---

## üî∏ 1. Phonemic Perception in Bilingual Infants

### üí° Key Idea:

* Babies are born with the ability to **distinguish all possible speech sounds** in all languages.
* But with age, their brain **focuses more on the sounds of their native language**, and they **lose sensitivity to non-native sounds**.

### üîÑ Implication:

* If a second language is introduced **later**, the baby‚Äôs brain may already be **tuned only to the first language**.
* It becomes **harder** to learn sounds that don‚Äôt exist in the first language.

> üìå Example: A Japanese baby at 12 months may not hear the difference between English /r/ and /l/, because in Japanese, these are treated as the same.

## üî∏ 2. Sequential vs. Simultaneous Bilingualism

### A. **Sequential Bilinguals**:

* Learn one language first, then the second language **later**.
* Problem: by the time they are exposed to the second language, their **brain might not recognize important phonemic contrasts** in the second language.

#### üß™ Study: *Kuhl et al., 2003*

* Exposed English-speaking infants to **Mandarin Chinese** for 12 sessions.
* Result: They **learned to perceive Mandarin contrasts**‚Äî**but only when exposed through live interaction** (not video/audio).

> üß† Conclusion: **Interactive, real-life exposure** helps restore the ability to hear unfamiliar phonemes.

### B. **Simultaneous Bilinguals**:

* Learn two languages **from birth**.
* Their brain processes **two sound systems at the same time**.

#### üß™ Study: *Maye et al., 2002*

* Infants use **statistical learning** to figure out sound categories.
* If babies hear two distinct sound patterns frequently ‚Üí they form two categories (bimodal input).
* If they hear a blended average ‚Üí they form only one category (unimodal input).

> üìå Example: If a baby hears both English /d/ and French /d/ regularly, they may learn to distinguish them. But if they hear only overlapping sounds, they may treat them as the same.

## üî∏ 3. Case Study: Catalan-Spanish Bilingual Infants

#### üß™ Study: *Bosch & Sebastian-Galles, 2003*

* Compared 4- and 8-month-old infants:

  * Spanish monolinguals
  * Catalan monolinguals
  * Catalan-Spanish bilinguals

* Sound contrast tested: /e/ in ‚Äúbait‚Äù vs. /…õ/ in ‚Äúbet‚Äù

  * **Catalan**: distinguishes these sounds.
  * **Spanish**: does not distinguish them clearly.

### Findings:

* At **4 months**, all infants could hear the contrast.
* At **8 months**:

  * **Spanish monolinguals** lost the ability.
  * **Catalan monolinguals** retained it.
  * **Bilinguals** behaved like Spanish monolinguals‚Äîthey initially **lost the ability** to distinguish.

> ‚ùì Why? Possibly due to **overlap in the two languages** confusing the brain.

### But‚Ä¶ by **12 months**, bilinguals **regained** the ability to distinguish the sounds.

> üß† Conclusion: **Simultaneous exposure slows down phonemic distinction**, but **does not prevent it**.

## üî∏ 4. Another Study: English-French /d/ Sound

#### üß™ Study: *Sundara et al., 2008*

* French and English have slightly different ways of producing /d/, but this is **not contrastive** (meaning-changing) in either.
* Still, English adults **notice the difference**, but French adults **don‚Äôt**.

### Tested:

* French monolinguals
* English monolinguals
* French-English bilingual infants (6‚Äì8 months and 10‚Äì12 months)

### Results:

* At 6‚Äì8 months: All infants noticed the /d/ differences.
* At 10‚Äì12 months:

  * French and English monolinguals **couldn‚Äôt notice the difference**.
  * **Bilinguals could**‚Äîjust like English adults.

> üß† Why? Because bilingual infants had **higher frequency exposure** to both types of /d/, so their brains kept both categories.

## üìå In Summary

| Concept                     | Explanation                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phonemic narrowing**      | Babies lose ability to hear unfamiliar sounds as they age.          |
| **Sequential bilinguals**   | Face difficulty learning new sounds if exposure is late.            |
| **Simultaneous bilinguals** | Learn both sets of sounds, but development may be delayed.          |
| **Statistical learning**    | Babies track frequency and patterns of sounds to create categories. |
| **Interactive exposure**    | Real-life interaction helps restore lost phonemic sensitivity.      |
| **Cross-language overlap**  | When similar sounds occur in both languages, distinction is harder. |
| **Frequency effect**        | Frequent hearing of different sounds helps infants maintain both.   |

## üìù Practice Questions

### **1. What challenges do sequential bilingual infants face in learning the sounds of a second language?**

**Hints:**

* Define phonemic narrowing.
* Talk about decreased sensitivity to non-native sounds.
* Mention Kuhl et al.‚Äôs Mandarin exposure study.

---

### **2. How do simultaneous bilingual infants develop phonemic categories?**

**Hints:**

* Explain dual input and statistical learning.
* Describe Catalan-Spanish study.
* Mention temporary delay but eventual success.

---

### **3. How does statistical distribution of speech sounds affect sound learning in infants?**

**Hints:**

* Use Maye et al. bimodal vs. unimodal study.
* Explain category formation from frequent exposure.

---

### **4. What role does the type of exposure (interactive vs. audio-only) play in phonemic learning?**

**Hints:**

* Refer to Kuhl et al.‚Äôs Mandarin study.
* Show why babies need human interaction.

---

### **5. What does research on French-English bilingual infants suggest about the role of frequency in phonemic development?**

**Hints:**
