### **1. Bilingualism and Multilingualism ‚Äì Definitions**

* **Bilingualism** is the ability of an individual to use two languages proficiently. This includes speaking, reading, writing, and understanding both languages with a functional level of fluency.

* **Multilingualism** extends this concept to more than two languages. A multilingual person can effectively communicate in three or more languages.

üî∏ *Note:* These terms are often used interchangeably in research and discourse, but the core idea is about **knowing and using more than one language**.

---

### **2. Dimensions: Individual vs Societal Phenomena**

* **Individual bilingualism/multilingualism** refers to a person's internal language knowledge and usage patterns. It includes how and when the individual acquired the languages, their fluency level in each, and how they use them in daily life.

* **Societal bilingualism/multilingualism** emerges when **entire communities or countries** function with more than one language. This is often influenced by historical, political, and economic factors such as colonization, migration, or national language policies.
  **Example**: India is a multilingual country where multiple regional languages co-exist with English.

---

### **3. Causes and Contexts of Bilingualism**

* **Migration** (due to war, jobs, education) leads to individuals acquiring additional languages.
* **Colonial history** (e.g., English in India, French in parts of Africa).
* **Education systems** that promote a second language from an early age.
* **Economic and political advantages** associated with certain languages (like English) also push individuals to become bilingual.

---

## üß† The Cognitive Side: Is Bilingualism Good for the Brain?

* **Yes!** Research suggests:

  * Better **attention** and **executive control** (multitasking, decision-making).
  * May **delay dementia or Alzheimer‚Äôs** by a few years.
  * Improves **communication** flexibility and cultural understanding.

> Just like exercising your body builds strength, using two languages exercises your brain!

## üìä Theoretical Framework: White‚Äôs Classification (1991)

Dr. Verma refers to a scholar named **White (1991)** who classified bilingual societies using **3 dimensions**. This helps us understand different bilingual/multilingual settings.

---

### 1. üî§ Types of Language Minorities:

Different ways in which a language can be considered "minor":

* **Unique language** in one place:

  * E.g., **Breton** in France ‚Äì only spoken there.
* **Non-unique but subordinate**:

  * E.g., **Basque** spoken in **Spain & France**, but it's not the main language in either.
* **Local minority but majority elsewhere**:

  * E.g., **French** in **Canada** is a minority, but in **France**, it's a majority language.

---

### 2. üåç Connection Between Speakers in Different Countries:

* **Adjoining regions**:

  * Languages spread across neighboring countries.
  * E.g., **Basque** in Spain and France (connected region).
* **Non-adjoining**:

  * Same language spoken in places far apart.
  * E.g., **French** in **Canada and France**.

---

### 3. üß≠ Spatial Cohesion:

* How tightly packed the speakers of a language are in one region.
* **Cohesive**: Speakers live close together (e.g., **Cree** in Canada).
* **Non-cohesive**: Speakers are spread out (e.g., **Spanish** speakers in USA).

---

## üî¨ Disciplinary Perspectives on Bilingualism

Different academic disciplines look at bilingualism in different ways. These help researchers understand how and why people become bilingual and what effects it has.

### 1. üìä Demographic Perspective:

* Studies population patterns.
* Focuses on **urban vs. rural** bilingualism.
* Example: People in cities may speak more languages due to diversity.

### 2. üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Sociological Perspective:

* Studies **society and social structures**.
* Looks at how **politics, class, migration** impact language use.

### 3. üó£ Linguistic Perspective:

* Studies **language structure**.
* Looks at how languages change due to contact (e.g., word borrowing, accent shifts).

### 4. üß† Social Psychological Perspective:

* Studies **beliefs, identity, and attitudes**.
* Questions:

  * Does speaking English give social prestige?
  * Do people feel more "modern" or "educated" when using certain languages?

## ‚úÖ CORE CONCEPT QUESTIONS

### **1. Define bilingualism and multilingualism. Discuss the challenges in defining who is a bilingual or multilingual speaker.**
