Here is a detailed breakdown of **PBM Lecture 6: "Language Acquisition in Bi/Multilinguals – II"** by Dr. Ark Verma. This explanation includes **clear points**, **examples**, and **key questions** to help you master the topic.

## 📘 THEME: Language Acquisition in Bi/Multilinguals – II

**Focus:** How infants perceive phonemes and how this ability changes with age and exposure.

---

### 🍼 1. Background

* Language acquisition in infants is studied using paradigms like HAS (High Amplitude Sucking).
* Research shows that infants can **differentiate speech sounds** (phonemes) from a very early age.

---

### 🔬 2. Key Experiment: **Eimas et al. (1971)**

* Studied **1- and 4-month-old infants** using **HAS paradigm**.
* Focus: Can babies distinguish between **/b/** and **/p/** using **Voice Onset Time (VOT)**?

#### 🧪 Experimental Design:

* **VOT < 25ms** = /b/
* **VOT > 25ms** = /p/
* Three groups:

  1. +20ms (habituation) → +40ms (test): across category boundary (/b/ to /p/)
  2. −20ms to 0ms OR +40ms to +60ms: within category (/b/ or /p/)
  3. Same sound repeated in both phases (control)

#### ✅ Result:

* Only group 1 showed renewed attention → **categorical perception**
* Infants perceived a **difference between phonemes**, like adults.

---

### 🧠 3. Concept: **Categorical Perception**

* The ability to hear differences **between** phoneme categories (e.g., /b/ vs /p/), but not **within** them.
* Found in **infants as young as 1 month**.
* This ability is likely **innate**, not learned.

---

### 🌐 4. Cross-Linguistic Insights

#### 🧭 Lisker & Abramson (1964):

* VOT boundaries vary by language.
* Different languages divide sound continua **differently**.

#### 🧠 Lasky et al. (1975):

* Infants below 7 months can perceive **non-native phonemes**.
* After this, ability **declines without exposure**.

> 🧠 Example: A Spanish infant may perceive Hindi phoneme differences at 5 months, but not at 11 months if not exposed.

### 🕰️ 5. Development Timeline (Kuhl, 2004)

| Age             | Ability                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **<6 months**   | Perceives all phoneme contrasts (native + non-native)      |
| **6–9 months**  | Begins to lose non-native contrasts                        |
| **\~9 months**  | Begins to recognize native phonotactics                    |
| **\~11 months** | Can no longer perceive most non-native consonant contrasts |

> 🔁 **Perceptual Reorganization** happens due to exposure to native language.

### 🧩 6. Debates on Categorical Perception

| View                      | Claim                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Eimas & Miller (1991)** | It's a **language-specific** ability, unique to humans.                       |
| **Kuhl & Miller (1978)**  | It's a **general perceptual** skill, seen in animals too (e.g., chinchillas). |

---

### ❓ Key Theoretical Questions (De Groot, 2011)

1. **When do humans lose the ability** to perceive non-native contrasts?
2. **How long** does it take to learn all native contrasts?
3. Do **bilinguals** lose or retain phonemic contrasts **differently** from monolinguals?

---

## 🎧 Why Do Infants Stop Hearing Sounds from Other Languages?

**(Explanation of Section 7: "Why Non-Native Contrast Perception Declines Differently")**

When babies are born, they can hear **all possible speech sounds** from any language.
But over time, they **stop noticing** many of the sounds **not used in their native language**.

However, some sounds are forgotten **sooner**, some are **retained longer**, and some **stay forever**.

So, why does this **decline in perception** of foreign sounds happen differently for different sounds?

Researchers have offered **three explanations**:

---

### 🧩 A. **Burnham (1986): Fragile vs. Robust Contrasts**

This theory says that **not all sounds are equal**—some are easier for babies to hear and remember.

#### ✅ Robust Contrasts:

* **What they are**: Loud, clear, and very **different-sounding** phonemes.
* **Where found**: Common in **many languages**.
* **What happens**: Babies find them **easy to detect**, so they may **keep recognizing them longer**, even without exposure.

#### ❌ Fragile Contrasts:

* **What they are**: Subtle, soft, **easily confused** sounds.
* **Where found**: Only in a **few rare languages**.
* **What happens**: Babies **forget them quickly** without repeated exposure.

> 🧠 **Example**: The Hindi sound **/ɖ/** (retroflex D) is rare and fragile for English babies—they will likely lose it if they don’t hear it often.

---

### 🧩 B. **Tees & Werker (1984): Allophone Similarity**

This explanation says:

* If a **foreign sound is similar** to a sound in the baby's language (even if not exactly the same), the baby will still **recognize it**.

#### 🔁 What are **allophones**?

* Different versions of the **same phoneme**.
* Example: In English, the sound **/t/** in "top" vs. "stop" is produced slightly differently, but we treat them as the **same letter**.

#### 🔍 Main Idea:

* If a **non-native phoneme** sounds like an **allophone** in the baby’s native language, the brain may keep that sound alive.
* But if there’s **no similar sound**, the brain forgets it.

> 🧠 **Example**: A Japanese infant may retain the English **“r”** sound only if it's **similar to an “r”-like** sound in Japanese.

---

### 🧩 C. **Best et al. (1994): Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM)**

This is the most famous and widely cited model.

#### 📌 Main Idea:

* Babies don't hear foreign sounds as **completely new**.
* Instead, they try to **“fit” them into familiar categories** from their own language.

This is called **perceptual assimilation**:
→ The baby **matches** the unknown sound with the **closest known sound**.

---

#### 💡 Types of Assimilation:

1. **Good Match**: If the foreign sound is **very close** to a native sound, baby hears it as the same.
2. **Poor Match**: If it’s only **somewhat similar**, baby might confuse it.
3. **No Match**: If there’s **no equivalent**, baby may **not hear the difference at all**.

> 🧠 **Example**:

* A French baby may hear the English **“th”** sound as either **/s/** or **/z**, because French doesn’t have “th”.
* So, instead of hearing it correctly, the baby **assimilates** it to something they know.

## 🔁 Summary Table

| Theory                      | Key Idea                                              | Why Perception Fades Differently                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Burnham (1986)**          | Some sounds are fragile, some robust                  | **Fragile = rare**, easily lost; **Robust = common**, remembered longer  |
| **Tees & Werker (1984)**    | Similar sounds = allophones                           | Babies keep sounds if they’re **similar to native allophones**           |
| **PAM (Best et al., 1994)** | Non-native sounds are "mapped" onto native categories | Babies don’t hear new sounds as new, but as **versions of known sounds** |


---

## ✅ Summary of Key Points

* Infants are **born with the ability** to distinguish all phonemes.
* With time and exposure to **native language**, non-native phoneme perception **declines**.
* This decline is **not universal** — depends on:

  * Sound salience,
  * Similarity to native phonemes,
  * Exposure environment.

---

## 🧠 Real-life Example

> A Japanese infant might initially hear both “r” and “l” like in English. But by 12 months, without English exposure, they might no longer distinguish these sounds, because Japanese doesn’t differentiate them.

---

## ✍️ ESSAY QUESTIONS + WRITING HINTS

---

### Q1. **What is categorical perception in infants, and how is it relevant to bilingual language acquisition?**

**Hint:**

* Define categorical perception with /b/ vs /p/.
* Describe **Eimas et al.** experiment.
* Talk about early ability to distinguish all languages’ sounds.
* Link it to **bilingual infants retaining more phoneme contrasts** due to exposure.

---

### Q2. **How does phoneme perception develop in infants, and what factors affect the decline of non-native contrast perception?**

**Hint:**

* Use **Kuhl’s timeline** (<6 months, 9 months, 11 months).
* Explain **perceptual reorganization**.
* Discuss theories: **Burnham (fragile/robust), PAM model, allophones**.
* Mention that decline isn’t equal for all contrasts or infants.
