### 1. **Interdisciplinary Nature of Bilingualism**

* **Explanation**:

  * Bilingualism is studied by **linguistics**, **psychology**, **neuroscience**, and **sociolinguistics**.
  * Each field brings its own **lens** (methods, goals, assumptions).

---

## 🧠 Psycholinguistic Approaches

### 2. **Focus**: Individual mental processes during language acquisition and usage.

### 3. **Weinreich’s (1953) Typology of Bilinguals**

| Type              | Description                                       | Example                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coordinative**  | Has separate conceptual systems for each language | Learns “apple” as “सेब” in Hindi and “apple” in English with separate concepts. |
| **Compound**      | Has a single concept with two labels              | Learns both “apple” and “सेब” as pointing to same fruit.                        |
| **Subordinative** | Accesses meaning in L2 via translation from L1    | Understands “pomme” (French) only by translating it to “apple” (English).       |

> 🔸 These are **fluid stages**, not fixed categories.
> 🔸 Reflect different **proficiency levels or development stages**.

### 4. **Potter et al. (1984): Lexical Representation Models**

| Model                 | Description                | Example                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Word Association**  | L2 → L1 word → Concept     | Learns “gato” (Spanish) → “cat” (English) → 🐱 |
| **Concept Mediation** | L2 word → Concept (direct) | Learns “gato” → 🐱 (without going via English) |

> 🔸 Less proficient users often rely on **word association**, fluent speakers use **concept mediation**.

---

### 5. **Revised Hierarchical Model (Kroll & Stewart, 1994)**

* Integrates both **Word Association** and **Concept Mediation**.
* **Beginners**: Stronger L2 → L1 links.
* **Fluent users**: Direct L2 → Concept links.

---

### 6. **Language Mode Model (Grosjean, 2001)**

* Language use depends on **context**:

  * **Listener**, **topic**, **setting**, etc.
* Bilinguals **switch modes** (monolingual, bilingual) rapidly.

> 🧠 Example: A Hindi-English bilingual might speak Hindi at home, but English in a seminar—even within minutes.

### 7. **Volterra & Taeschner (1978): Bilingual Language Acquisition Stages**

| Stage         | Features                                                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stage I**   | Mixed lexicon (words from both languages used randomly).              |
| **Stage II**  | Recognizes two lexicons but applies one grammar.                      |
| **Stage III** | Separate lexicon and grammar for each; uses appropriately by context. |

---

### 8. **Debate: One System or Two?**

* Some researchers argue bilinguals have **two separate systems**.
* Others claim they use a **merged, interactive grammar** that adapts dynamically.

---

## 🗣 Linguistic Approach

### 9. **Focus**: Language **structure change** due to **contact**.

* **Winford (2003)**: Contact situations include:

| Type                     | Description                                  | Example                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Language Maintenance** | Borrowing without language loss              | Sanskrit’s influence on Dravidian.  |
| **Language Shift**       | One language dominates and changes the other | English influenced by Irish syntax. |
| **Language Creation**    | New language from two                        | Urdu from Hindi + Persian.          |

### 10. **Grammatical System Debate**

* Some say bilinguals use **two separate grammars**.
* Others support a **blended grammar** (code-mixing, interaction).

> 🧠 Example: Hinglish speakers use “main party mein jaa raha hoon”—mix of English-Hindi.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Sociolinguistic Approaches

### 11. **Focus**: Language and **identity**

* Language is not just communication—it’s **self-expression**.

### 12. **Language Choice = Identity Statement**

* Choosing a language reflects **history, culture, community**.

| Theory                               | Focus                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Le Page & Tabouret-Keller (1985)** | Language = identity marker.                          |
| **Labov (1972)**                     | Socioeconomic class, gender, age influence identity. |
| **Cameron & Johnstone**              | Identity negotiated via social interactions.         |
| **Tajfel (1974)**                    | Identity = group processes, in-group vs. out-group.  |

| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Psycholinguistic** | Mind, proficiency, lexical access | Coordinative, Compound, Mediation |
| **Linguistic**       | Structure, grammar, contact       | Maintenance, Shift, Creation      |
| **Sociolinguistic**  | Identity, social meaning          | Language choice, self vs. other   |

## ✍️ Possible Essay Questions + Writing Hints

---

### Q1. **Discuss the psycholinguistic models of bilingual lexical representation. How do they account for proficiency and language use?**

**Hint**:

* Begin with **psycholinguistics' focus** on mental processes.
* Explain **Weinreich’s types**, Potter et al. models.
* Detail **Revised Hierarchical Model (Kroll & Stewart)**.
* Include **examples** (e.g., word association vs. concept mediation).
* End with the idea that proficiency and usage determine **which model applies**.

---

### Q2. **How do linguistic and sociolinguistic approaches explain the dynamics of bilingualism?**

**Hint**:

* Contrast **linguistic** (grammar, contact-induced change) vs. **sociolinguistic** (identity).
* Explain **Winford’s taxonomy** and provide examples (Urdu, Irish-English).
* Discuss **language as a marker of identity**, citing Labov, Tajfel, etc.
* Use real-life examples (e.g., English in urban India, code-switching in media).

## 💡 Sample Example-Based Question

> **Q**: How would a child raised in a Hindi-English household progress through the stages of bilingual acquisition?
> **A**: Use Volterra & Taeschner's 3 stages to explain:

* Stage I: Uses “ball” and “गेंद” interchangeably.
* Stage II: Says “I have गेंद”, mixing lexicons with one grammar.
* Stage III: Knows when to say “ball” vs. “गेंद” based on context and speaker.
