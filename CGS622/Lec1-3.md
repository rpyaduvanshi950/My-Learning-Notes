### **1. Bilingualism and Multilingualism ‚Äì Definitions**

* **Bilingualism** is the ability of an individual to use two languages proficiently. This includes speaking, reading, writing, and understanding both languages with a functional level of fluency.

* **Multilingualism** extends this concept to more than two languages. A multilingual person can effectively communicate in three or more languages.

üî∏ *Note:* These terms are often used interchangeably in research and discourse, but the core idea is about **knowing and using more than one language**.

---

### **2. Dimensions: Individual vs Societal Phenomena**

* **Individual bilingualism/multilingualism** refers to a person's internal language knowledge and usage patterns. It includes how and when the individual acquired the languages, their fluency level in each, and how they use them in daily life.

* **Societal bilingualism/multilingualism** emerges when **entire communities or countries** function with more than one language. This is often influenced by historical, political, and economic factors such as colonization, migration, or national language policies.
  **Example**: India is a multilingual country where multiple regional languages co-exist with English.

---

### **3. Causes and Contexts of Bilingualism**

* **Migration** (due to war, jobs, education) leads to individuals acquiring additional languages.
* **Colonial history** (e.g., English in India, French in parts of Africa).
* **Education systems** that promote a second language from an early age.
* **Economic and political advantages** associated with certain languages (like English) also push individuals to become bilingual.

---

## üß† The Cognitive Side: Is Bilingualism Good for the Brain?

* **Yes!** Research suggests:

  * Better **attention** and **executive control** (multitasking, decision-making).
  * May **delay dementia or Alzheimer‚Äôs** by a few years.
  * Improves **communication** flexibility and cultural understanding.

> Just like exercising your body builds strength, using two languages exercises your brain!

## üìä Theoretical Framework: White‚Äôs Classification (1991)

Dr. Verma refers to a scholar named **White (1991)** who classified bilingual societies using **3 dimensions**. This helps us understand different bilingual/multilingual settings.

---

### 1. üî§ Types of Language Minorities:

Different ways in which a language can be considered "minor":

* **Unique language** in one place:

  * E.g., **Breton** in France ‚Äì only spoken there.
* **Non-unique but subordinate**:

  * E.g., **Basque** spoken in **Spain & France**, but it's not the main language in either.
* **Local minority but majority elsewhere**:

  * E.g., **French** in **Canada** is a minority, but in **France**, it's a majority language.

---

### 2. üåç Connection Between Speakers in Different Countries:

* **Adjoining regions**:

  * Languages spread across neighboring countries.
  * E.g., **Basque** in Spain and France (connected region).
* **Non-adjoining**:

  * Same language spoken in places far apart.
  * E.g., **French** in **Canada and France**.

---

### 3. üß≠ Spatial Cohesion:

* How tightly packed the speakers of a language are in one region.
* **Cohesive**: Speakers live close together (e.g., **Cree** in Canada).
* **Non-cohesive**: Speakers are spread out (e.g., **Spanish** speakers in USA).

---

## üî¨ Disciplinary Perspectives on Bilingualism

Different academic disciplines look at bilingualism in different ways. These help researchers understand how and why people become bilingual and what effects it has.

### 1. üìä Demographic Perspective:

* Studies population patterns.
* Focuses on **urban vs. rural** bilingualism.
* Example: People in cities may speak more languages due to diversity.

### 2. üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Sociological Perspective:

* Studies **society and social structures**.
* Looks at how **politics, class, migration** impact language use.

### 3. üó£ Linguistic Perspective:

* Studies **language structure**.
* Looks at how languages change due to contact (e.g., word borrowing, accent shifts).

### 4. üß† Social Psychological Perspective:

* Studies **beliefs, identity, and attitudes**.
* Questions:

  * Does speaking English give social prestige?
  * Do people feel more "modern" or "educated" when using certain languages?

---

### **6. Language Proficiency ‚Äì Concept and Measurement**

* **Proficiency** refers to how well a person can use a language in different modalities ‚Äì speaking, listening, reading, and writing ‚Äì along with vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

* Earlier, studies relied on **self-assessed proficiency**, which can be subjective and inflated.

* Now, **objective tests** (rating scales, fluency, comprehension tests) are preferred, though still imperfect.

* **Balanced bilinguals** are equally proficient in both languages.

* **Receptive bilinguals** understand but may not produce the second language fluently.

* **Productive bilinguals** can both understand and express themselves in the language.

* **Additive bilingualism** enriches the linguistic repertoire without compromising the first language.

* **Subtractive bilingualism** may result in the weakening of the first language.

---

### **7. Cognitive & Neurological Outcomes**

* **Peal & Lambert (1962)**: First empirical evidence that bilingual children outperform monolinguals on both **verbal and non-verbal intelligence** tests.

* **Bialystok (2009, 2010)**:

  * Bilinguals may have **enhanced executive functions**, like better multitasking, attention control, and cognitive flexibility.
  * Bilingualism may **delay the onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease** by several years due to stronger cognitive reserve.

* These findings suggest that **bilingualism doesn‚Äôt just help communication**, but also **enhances brain function**.

---

### **8. Language Contact Outcomes**

* **Territorial Bilingualism**: Languages are associated with specific regions (e.g., Tamil in Tamil Nadu, English for jobs).

* **Diglossia**: Different languages used in different contexts. One is for formal settings, another for informal.
  Example: Sanskrit for religious rituals, Hindi for daily conversation.

* **Widespread Multilingualism**: Coexistence of several languages within and between communities, especially in India and Africa.

---

### **9. Acquisition of Second Language**

* **Natural acquisition**: Occurs through daily interaction (e.g., family, peer group).

* **School-based acquisition**: Structured learning environment.

* Key factors:

  * **Motivation**
  * **Aptitude**
  * **Opportunity**
  * **Cultural context**
  * **Access to speakers**

---

### **10. Critical Period Hypothesis (Lenneberg, 1967)**

* Proposes that **language acquisition is most effective during early childhood**, typically before puberty.
* After this critical window, it becomes **harder to attain native-like fluency** in a new language.

---

### **11. Language Storage in the Brain**

* Debate: Are languages stored **separately** or in a **shared system** in the brain?

  * Some believe orthography (spelling), phonology (sound), and semantics (meaning) are shared.
  * Others argue that each language has distinct neural representations.

* Influencing factors:

  * Age of acquisition
  * Proficiency level
  * Frequency of use

---

### **12. Code-switching and Code-mixing**

* **Code-switching**: Shifting between two languages within a single conversation or sentence.

  * Example: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the bazaar and then grab some coffee.‚Äù

* **Code-mixing**: Mixing grammar and vocabulary from different languages.

  * Often used as a stylistic or communicative strategy.

---

### **13. Language and Identity**

* Language is **deeply tied to cultural identity** and group belonging.
* Bilingual individuals may feel they express **different parts of their personality** through each language.
* Example (Grosjean, 1982): People report feeling like a ‚Äúdifferent person‚Äù depending on which language they speak.

---

### **14. Linguistic Diversity and Classification**

* **Universal Grammar (Chomsky)**: All human languages share a common structural core due to innate cognitive structures.

* **Design Features (Hockett)**: Characteristics shared by all human languages (e.g., displacement, productivity, arbitrariness).

* **Classification Types**:

  * **Genetic**: Based on ancestry and language families.
  * **Typological**: Based on word order (SVO, SOV).
  * **Areal**: Based on geography and long-term contact.
