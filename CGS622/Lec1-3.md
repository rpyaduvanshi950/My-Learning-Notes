### **1. Bilingualism and Multilingualism ‚Äì Definitions**

* **Bilingualism** is the ability of an individual to use two languages proficiently. This includes speaking, reading, writing, and understanding both languages with a functional level of fluency.

* **Multilingualism** extends this concept to more than two languages. A multilingual person can effectively communicate in three or more languages.

üî∏ *Note:* These terms are often used interchangeably in research and discourse, but the core idea is about **knowing and using more than one language**.

---

### **2. Dimensions: Individual vs Societal Phenomena**

* **Individual bilingualism/multilingualism** refers to a person's internal language knowledge and usage patterns. It includes how and when the individual acquired the languages, their fluency level in each, and how they use them in daily life.

* **Societal bilingualism/multilingualism** emerges when **entire communities or countries** function with more than one language. This is often influenced by historical, political, and economic factors such as colonization, migration, or national language policies.
  **Example**: India is a multilingual country where multiple regional languages co-exist with English.

---

### **3. Causes and Contexts of Bilingualism**

* **Migration** (due to war, jobs, education) leads to individuals acquiring additional languages.
* **Colonial history** (e.g., English in India, French in parts of Africa).
* **Education systems** that promote a second language from an early age.
* **Economic and political advantages** associated with certain languages (like English) also push individuals to become bilingual.

---

### **4. Types of Bilingualism (White, 1991 ‚Äì via Bhatia & Ritchie, 2013)**
## üîπ 1. **Types of Language Minorities**

This categorization is based on **how widespread or dominant a language is in a particular region** and how it interacts with the dominant language(s).

### a. **Unique Language Minorities**

* These are languages spoken **only in one state or region**, often by a small population, and not found elsewhere.
* They are highly localized and culturally specific.
* **Example**: *Breton in France* ‚Äì a Celtic language spoken by a minority in Brittany. It has no significant presence outside that region.

üî∏ **Why important?**
Such languages are often at risk of extinction and need protection and preservation. They reflect **deep cultural and historical identities**.

---

### b. **Non-Unique but Subordinate Languages**

* These are languages spoken in **more than one country**, but they hold a **subordinate or minority status** in each.
* **Example**: *Basque* ‚Äì spoken in both **Spain and France**, but not dominant in either.

üî∏ **Why important?**
Speakers often struggle with language maintenance due to **pressure from dominant national languages**, e.g., Spanish and French in this case. It raises issues of **linguistic rights** and **cultural autonomy**.

---

### c. **Local-Only Minorities**

* These are languages that are **minority in one region**, but **majority in another**.
* **Example**: *French in Canada* ‚Äì It is **a majority in Quebec**, but a **minority** in most other provinces.

üî∏ **Why important?**
This reflects the **tension between regional and national language policies**, and may lead to **territorial bilingualism**, political activism, or demands for autonomy.

---

## üîπ 2. **Speaker Connections Across Borders**

This dimension concerns the **geographical arrangement** of language communities across **national boundaries**.

### a. **Adjoining Language Communities**

* Language communities that are **geographically adjacent**, often on **both sides of a national border**.
* **Example**: *Basque speakers in Spain and France* ‚Äì the Basque region straddles the border.

üî∏ **Why important?**
Adjoining communities often maintain **strong cross-border cultural and linguistic ties**, making language maintenance easier. Shared festivals, media, and education can help sustain minority languages.

---

### b. **Non-Adjoining Language Communities**

* These are language communities that are **not geographically connected** and are found in **completely separate regions**.
* **Example**: *French in France and in Canada* ‚Äì there is **no direct geographical continuity**.

üî∏ **Why important?**
These communities often develop **different dialects, accents, or even cultural identities** over time. Maintaining linguistic unity becomes more difficult, and the **sense of shared identity may weaken**.

---

## üîπ 3. **Spatial Cohesion Within a State**

This distinction focuses on **how concentrated or dispersed** speakers of a language are **within a single country**.

### a. **Cohesive Language Communities**

* The speakers are **concentrated in one or more geographic regions**, forming a **tight-knit community**.
* **Example**: *Cree in Canada* ‚Äì Cree speakers often live in specific First Nations communities or reservations.

üî∏ **Why important?**
Cohesion helps with **language preservation**, community schooling, and policy advocacy. It allows **local governance and cultural expression** in the native language.

---

### b. **Non-Cohesive Language Communities**

* The speakers are **scattered across the country**, often living as **linguistic minorities in larger, dominant language communities**.
* **Example**: *Spanish in the USA* ‚Äì Though there are many Spanish speakers, they are **spread out** across various states and cities.

üî∏ **Why important?**
Lack of cohesion makes it harder to preserve and transmit the language to future generations. It also **reduces visibility and political influence**. Language loss is more likely in such settings unless supported by strong community institutions.

---

### **5. Disciplinary Perspectives on Bilingualism**

* **Demographic**: Focuses on rural vs urban distribution, migration, and how these factors influence language survival or decline.

* **Sociological**: Studies the role of institutions, policies, and social norms in shaping bilingualism.

* **Linguistic**: Analyzes how languages change structurally due to contact (e.g., new vocabulary or syntax).

* **Social Psychological**: Looks at attitudes toward languages, identity formation, and group dynamics.

---

### **6. Language Proficiency ‚Äì Concept and Measurement**

* **Proficiency** refers to how well a person can use a language in different modalities ‚Äì speaking, listening, reading, and writing ‚Äì along with vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

* Earlier, studies relied on **self-assessed proficiency**, which can be subjective and inflated.

* Now, **objective tests** (rating scales, fluency, comprehension tests) are preferred, though still imperfect.

* **Balanced bilinguals** are equally proficient in both languages.

* **Receptive bilinguals** understand but may not produce the second language fluently.

* **Productive bilinguals** can both understand and express themselves in the language.

* **Additive bilingualism** enriches the linguistic repertoire without compromising the first language.

* **Subtractive bilingualism** may result in the weakening of the first language.

---

### **7. Cognitive & Neurological Outcomes**

* **Peal & Lambert (1962)**: First empirical evidence that bilingual children outperform monolinguals on both **verbal and non-verbal intelligence** tests.

* **Bialystok (2009, 2010)**:

  * Bilinguals may have **enhanced executive functions**, like better multitasking, attention control, and cognitive flexibility.
  * Bilingualism may **delay the onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease** by several years due to stronger cognitive reserve.

* These findings suggest that **bilingualism doesn‚Äôt just help communication**, but also **enhances brain function**.

---

### **8. Language Contact Outcomes**

* **Territorial Bilingualism**: Languages are associated with specific regions (e.g., Tamil in Tamil Nadu, English for jobs).

* **Diglossia**: Different languages used in different contexts. One is for formal settings, another for informal.
  Example: Sanskrit for religious rituals, Hindi for daily conversation.

* **Widespread Multilingualism**: Coexistence of several languages within and between communities, especially in India and Africa.

---

### **9. Acquisition of Second Language**

* **Natural acquisition**: Occurs through daily interaction (e.g., family, peer group).

* **School-based acquisition**: Structured learning environment.

* Key factors:

  * **Motivation**
  * **Aptitude**
  * **Opportunity**
  * **Cultural context**
  * **Access to speakers**

---

### **10. Critical Period Hypothesis (Lenneberg, 1967)**

* Proposes that **language acquisition is most effective during early childhood**, typically before puberty.
* After this critical window, it becomes **harder to attain native-like fluency** in a new language.

---

### **11. Language Storage in the Brain**

* Debate: Are languages stored **separately** or in a **shared system** in the brain?

  * Some believe orthography (spelling), phonology (sound), and semantics (meaning) are shared.
  * Others argue that each language has distinct neural representations.

* Influencing factors:

  * Age of acquisition
  * Proficiency level
  * Frequency of use

---

### **12. Code-switching and Code-mixing**

* **Code-switching**: Shifting between two languages within a single conversation or sentence.

  * Example: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the bazaar and then grab some coffee.‚Äù

* **Code-mixing**: Mixing grammar and vocabulary from different languages.

  * Often used as a stylistic or communicative strategy.

---

### **13. Language and Identity**

* Language is **deeply tied to cultural identity** and group belonging.
* Bilingual individuals may feel they express **different parts of their personality** through each language.
* Example (Grosjean, 1982): People report feeling like a ‚Äúdifferent person‚Äù depending on which language they speak.

---

### **14. Linguistic Diversity and Classification**

* **Universal Grammar (Chomsky)**: All human languages share a common structural core due to innate cognitive structures.

* **Design Features (Hockett)**: Characteristics shared by all human languages (e.g., displacement, productivity, arbitrariness).

* **Classification Types**:

  * **Genetic**: Based on ancestry and language families.
  * **Typological**: Based on word order (SVO, SOV).
  * **Areal**: Based on geography and long-term contact.
