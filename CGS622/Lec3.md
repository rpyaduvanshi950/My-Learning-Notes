## üß† **Topic: Conceptual Issues in Bilingualism ‚Äì Part I**

This lecture looks at the **deep structure** of how multiple languages interact inside a person and within society. It also explains **language diversity**, **language contact**, and how **bilingual brains** manage two or more languages.

---

### üî∏ 1. Interaction Between Languages in the Brain

When a person speaks two or more languages:

* Their **linguistic systems interact**.
* This interaction happens at several levels:

  * **Sounds** (phonology)
  * **Words** (vocabulary)
  * **Grammar** (syntax and sentence formation)

> üß† Example: A Hindi-English bilingual might say ‚ÄúI will *le aata*‚Äù (mixing English with Hindi grammar) ‚Äì this shows interaction between the two systems.

These systems influence each other and don‚Äôt always stay separate.

---

### üî∏ 2. üåé Linguistic Diversity and Language Universals

There are **thousands of languages**, but they often follow **common patterns**.

#### üîπ Chomsky‚Äôs Universal Grammar:

* All human beings are born with an **innate ability** to learn language.
* This ‚Äúlanguage organ‚Äù in the brain explains why children learn languages so easily.

#### üîπ Hockett‚Äôs Design Features (1961):

* All languages have **shared features**, like:

  * Use of sound
  * Structure (grammar)
  * Creativity (new sentences)

> Example: Hindi and English both use subjects, verbs, and objects in sentences ‚Äì they are different but based on **similar universal principles**.

---

### üî∏ 3. üß¨ Explaining Language Differences (Diversity)

There are **two main approaches** to explaining why languages differ:

#### A. **Historical Approach**:

* Languages evolve and **change** when people from different language groups come in contact.
* New languages sometimes form (e.g., **Creoles** like Urdu, which mixes Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Hindi roots).
* This leads to different **classification systems**:

1. **Genetic Classification**:

   * Based on **common ancestors**.
   * Example: Hindi, English, and German all belong to the **Indo-European family**.

2. **Typological Classification**:

   * Based on **sentence structure** (word order).
   * Example:

     * English: Subject‚ÄìVerb‚ÄìObject (SVO): *I eat mango*.
     * Hindi: Subject‚ÄìObject‚ÄìVerb (SOV): *Main aam khata hoon*.

3. **Areal Classification**:

   * Based on **geography and language contact**.
   * Example: Balkan languages (like Greek, Albanian) influenced each other due to long co-existence.

#### B. **Social-Political Approach**:

* Languages vs. Dialects is often a **political decision**.
* Example: Mandarin and Cantonese are called "dialects" in China, but they are as different as Hindi and Tamil.

### üî∏ 4. üåê Consequences of Language Contact (How Languages Mix)

When different language-speaking communities interact, they form **new language systems**:

1. **Territorial Bilingualism**:

   * Each region uses its own language.
   * Example: India ‚Äì Tamil in Tamil Nadu, Bengali in West Bengal, but English/Hindi common across.

2. **Diglossia**:

   * Two languages exist in society with **different roles**.
   * Example: **Sanskrit** used for rituals (high domain), **Hindi** for everyday use (low domain).

3. **Widespread Multilingualism**:

   * Many languages used freely across regions.
   * Example: Southern India ‚Äì people use Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, English, and Hindi together.

### üî∏ 5. üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Individual Bilingualism

People become bilingual in many ways:

* **By birth** (e.g., parents speak different languages)
* **Through schooling** (e.g., English medium)
* **For jobs or migration** (e.g., moving to Germany, learning German)

### üîπ Key Biological & Cognitive Factors:

* **Age**: Younger people learn faster.
* **Working memory**: Helps in holding and switching between languages.
* **Brain health** and **intelligence** also affect learning.

#### üß† The Critical Period Hypothesis (Lenneberg, 1967):

* There is a **window of time (early age)** when language learning is easiest.
* After this period, learning a **native-like** second language becomes harder.

> Example: A child learning English at age 5 may sound fluent, but a 30-year-old learner may always have an accent.

---

### üî∏ 6. üß† How Are Languages Stored in the Brain?

Key questions researchers ask:

* Are the two languages stored in **separate parts** of the brain?
* Or are **phonology, vocabulary, and grammar** stored **together**?

The answer may depend on:

* **Age of learning** (early vs. late bilinguals)
* **Proficiency** in each language
* **Language similarity** (Hindi-Urdu vs. Hindi-English)

### üî∏ 7. üîÑ Language Modes

A bilingual person‚Äôs **language use changes** based on setting.

| Mode                 | Description                                        | Example                                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Monolingual Mode** | Using just one language                            | Giving a speech entirely in English       |
| **Bilingual Mode**   | Switching languages                                | Casual talk: ‚ÄúKya bolti tu, let‚Äôs go na!‚Äù |
| **Code-Switching**   | Shifting from one language to another mid-sentence | ‚ÄúI went to bazaar, phir ghar aaya.‚Äù       |
| **Code-Mixing**      | Mixing words from one language into another        | ‚ÄúYeh *assignment* kal submit karna hai.‚Äù  |

| Critical Period      | Best age to learn languages               | Children vs. adults learning English |
| Code-switching       | Switching languages mid-sentence          | ‚ÄúAaj class cancel hai, let‚Äôs chill.‚Äù |
