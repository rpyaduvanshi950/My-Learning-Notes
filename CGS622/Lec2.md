## üß† FOCUS: The Individual in Bilingualism ‚Äì Proficiency

---

### üîπ 1. What is Language Proficiency?

* Not all bilinguals/multilinguals have the same **level of skill** in each language.
* Proficiency means how well someone can:

  * **Speak**
  * **Listen (comprehend)**
  * **Read**
  * **Write**

#### üß© Example:

Someone might be able to **understand Tamil perfectly** but struggle to speak it. This means they have **high receptive** but **low productive proficiency** in Tamil.

---

### üîπ 2. Why Self-Rating is Problematic

* People often **overestimate** how fluent they are in a second language.
* This creates **bias** in research studies.
* Most studies still depend on **self-reported proficiency**, but this can be unreliable.

---

### üîπ 3. Objective Proficiency Testing

Researchers now try to use:

* Fluency tests (how smoothly someone speaks)
* Vocabulary tests
* Dominance tests (which language is stronger)
* Listening and writing tasks

However, even these have **limitations**, like being context-dependent or culturally biased.

---

## üìö Historical Views: Is Being Bilingual Good or Bad?

* It was **once believed** that bilingualism was **harmful**, especially for children.
* People thought it delayed cognitive development.

### ‚úÖ But research changed that:

**Peal & Lambert (1962)** showed:

* Bilingual children had **higher verbal & non-verbal IQs** than monolinguals.

This started a shift in how researchers viewed bilingualism.

---

## üåü Modern Theories: More Than Just Language

### üîπ Bialystok (2009, 2010):

* Bilinguals show **better cognitive control**, such as multitasking and switching attention.
* Delay in **dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs** symptoms (on average by 4‚Äì5 years).

## üéØ Different Types of Bilinguals

Researchers use many terms:

| Term                         | Meaning                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Balanced Bilingual**       | Equal proficiency in both languages.                              |
| **Ambilingual/Equilingual**  | Rare case where both languages are equally strong in all aspects. |
| **Receptive Bilingual**      | Understands a language but cannot speak it well.                  |
| **Productive Bilingual**     | Can speak and write the language.                                 |
| **Additive Bilingualism**    | New language adds to skills.                                      |
| **Subtractive Bilingualism** | New language replaces old language.                               |

> Example: A child who moves from a Hindi-medium school to an English-medium one may lose fluency in Hindi (**subtractive bilingualism**) unless actively maintained.

## üß† How Do People Learn Multiple Languages?

There are two main routes:

| Type                         | Explanation                            | Example                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Natural Acquisition**      | Informal, through family or community. | A Bengali child in Kolkata learning Hindi from neighbors. |
| **School-based Acquisition** | Formal instruction in classrooms.      | Learning French as a second language in school.           |

Success depends on:

* **Motivation**
* **Aptitude**
* **Opportunity**

---

## üí° Is It Only Language That They Learn?

No! They also gain **cognitive advantages**:

* Better memory
* Improved executive function
* Resistance to cognitive decline
* Cultural flexibility

---

## üîÑ Language Mixing: Natural Phenomena

### üîπ Code-Switching:

* Alternating between languages while speaking.

> Example: ‚ÄúMujhe woh file bhejna, *I‚Äôll send it in the evening*.‚Äù

### üîπ Cross-Language Interference:

* One language affects the use of another.

> Example: A Hindi speaker saying "I am going market" (missing the article ‚Äúto‚Äù) influenced by Hindi structure.

### üîπ Transfer Effects:

* Learning in one language influences performance in another.

> Example: Spelling patterns learned in French affecting English writing.

---

## üß¨ Language and Identity

* Language carries **culture, traditions, values**, and **group belonging**.
* People often feel a **different self** in each language.

### üîπ Grosjean (1982):

* Some bilinguals report **different personalities** in each language.

> Example: Someone might feel more confident speaking in English in professional settings, but more emotional and expressive in their native language at home.

### üîπ Language and Nationhood:

* Many **states or nations** are formed around linguistic identities.

> Example: **Bangladesh** was formed partly due to a **language movement** to protect Bengali.
