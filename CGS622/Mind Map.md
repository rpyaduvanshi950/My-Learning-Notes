LANGUAGE ACQUISITION IN BI/MULTILINGUALS – I
│
├── 🍼 Introduction: Studying Infant Language
│   ├── Data collection is indirect
│   ├── Must infer from behavior
│   ├── Harder in multilingual contexts (multiple systems)
│
├── 🎯 Key Challenges in Acquisition
│   ├── Distinguishing phonemes
│   ├── Recognizing auditory words
│   ├── Mapping word meanings
│   └── Building grammatical sentences
│
├── 🧪 Methods to Study Infant Language
│
│   ├── 📌 Habituation / Familiarization Paradigm
│   │   ├── Repeated stimulus loses interest
│   │   ├── New sound regains attention
│   │   └── Indicates sound discrimination
│
│   ├── 📌 High-Amplitude Sucking (HAS)
│   │   ├── Used on newborns
│   │   ├── Sucking rate/pressure = attention
│   │   ├── Detects phonemic contrast
│   │   └── Example: Eimas et al. (1971) – /p/ vs /b/
│
│   ├── 📌 Heart-Rate Paradigm
│   │   ├── Measures heartbeat changes
│   │   ├── Increased rate = increased attention
│   │   └── Tracks stimulus novelty
│
│   ├── 📌 Preferential Looking Technique
│   │   ├── Tests older infants
│   │   ├── Direction of gaze indicates detection
│   │   └── New sound = baby turns head to source
│
│   └── 📌 Head-Turn Procedure (Kemler-Nelson et al.)
│       ├── Trains infant to turn to stimulus
│       ├── New sound triggers head turn
│       └── Accurate detection of sound changes
│
└── 📌 Final Notes
    ├── Choice of paradigm depends on:
    │   ├── Research question
    │   └── Infant age/capabilities
    └── All methods infer internal learning via behavior

```
LANGUAGE ACQUISITION IN INFANTS (BI/MULTILINGUAL) – II
│
├── 📌 CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION
│   ├── Infants perceive phonemic contrasts (e.g., /b/ vs /p/)
│   ├── Tested by Eimas et al. (1971) using HAS paradigm
│   ├── Result: Infants noticed change across VOT boundary
│   └── Conclusion: Speech perception ability is innate
│
├── 🌐 CROSS-LINGUISTIC INSIGHTS
│   ├── Lisker & Abramson (1964): VOT boundaries vary by language
│   ├── Lasky et al. (1975): <7-month-olds perceive all phonemes
│   └── Perception declines without exposure to non-native languages
│
├── 🕰️ DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE (Kuhl, 2004)
│   ├── <6 months: Universal phoneme perception
│   ├── 6–9 months: Decline in non-native perception begins
│   ├── ~9 months: Native phonotactics start emerging
│   └── ~11 months: Non-native consonant perception mostly gone
│
├── 🔍 PERCEPTUAL REORGANIZATION
│   ├── Experience-dependent process
│   ├── Native language contrast detection improves
│   └── Non-native contrast perception fades with age
│
├── ❓ KEY QUESTIONS (De Groot, 2011)
│   ├── When does non-native contrast loss begin?
│   ├── How long to master native contrasts?
│   └── Is the decline different for bilinguals vs monolinguals?
│
├── 🧠 EXPLANATIONS FOR VARIABILITY
│   ├── 🔸 Burnham (1986): Fragile vs Robust Contrasts
│   ├── 🔸 Tees & Werker (1984): Allophones aid retention
│   └── 🔸 Best et al. (1994): Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM)
│       └── Non-native phonemes mapped to native categories
│
└── 📌 SUMMARY
    ├── Categorical perception is foundational
    ├── Native contrast perception improves with age
    ├── Non-native contrast perception declines
    └── Decline varies by sound, language, and experience

```text
Language Acquisition in Bi/Multilinguals – III
│
├── 1. Phonemic Development
│   ├── Native language phoneme perception ↑ with age
│   └── Non-native phoneme perception ↓ with age
│
├── 2. Sequential Bilingualism
│   ├── Second language learned after first
│   ├── Brain becomes language-specific before L2
│   └── Harder to acquire new phonemes (e.g., Japanese /l/ vs /r/)
│
│   └── Study: Kuhl et al. (2003)
│       ├── English infants exposed to Mandarin
│       ├── Live interaction enabled phoneme learning
│       └── Audio/video exposure failed to produce same effect
│
├── 3. Simultaneous Bilingualism
│   ├── Two languages from birth
│   ├── Brain processes two phonetic systems at once
│   └── Uses statistical learning to form phoneme categories
│
│   └── Study: Maye et al. (2002, 2006)
│       ├── Bimodal input → 2 phoneme categories
│       └── Unimodal input → 1 phoneme category
│
│   └── Study: Bosch & Sebastian-Galles (2003)
│       ├── Tested Catalan-Spanish infants (4, 8, 12 months)
│       ├── Sound: /e/ in "bait" vs /ɛ/ in "bet"
│       ├── 8-month bilinguals failed to perceive contrast
│       └── 12-month bilinguals regained ability
│
├── 4. Influence of Cross-Language Overlap
│   ├── Similar sounds between languages delay contrast development
│   └── May form single category due to overlap
│
├── 5. Frequency of Exposure
│   ├── Frequent hearing of phonemes → better distinction
│   └── Interaction between distribution and frequency
│
│   └── Study: Sundara et al. (2008)
│       ├── French-English bilingual infants
│       ├── Discriminated English /d/ vs French /d/
│       └── Frequency overcomes distributional overlap
│
└── 6. Summary Points
    ├── Simultaneous bilinguals = slower but successful phonemic development
    ├── Cross-language distribution delays development
    └── Frequency and interaction play critical roles
