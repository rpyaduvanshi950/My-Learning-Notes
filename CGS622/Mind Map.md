## **Lecture 2: The Individual in Bilingualism – Proficiency**

```plaintext
THE INDIVIDUAL IN BILINGUALISM – PROFICIENCY

1. Language Proficiency
   ├── Unequal across skills
   │   ├── Speaking
   │   ├── Listening
   │   ├── Reading
   │   └── Writing
   └── Example: Understand Tamil (high receptive), but cannot speak (low productive)

2. Problems with Self-Rating
   ├── Overestimation by individuals
   ├── Research bias
   └── Still widely used in studies

3. Objective Proficiency Testing
   ├── Fluency tests
   ├── Vocabulary tests
   ├── Dominance tests
   └── Listening & writing tasks
       └── Limitations: context-dependency, cultural bias

4. Historical Perspectives
   ├── Past view: Bilingualism is harmful (especially for kids)
   └── Shift due to Peal & Lambert (1962)
       └── Bilingual kids had higher IQ (verbal & non-verbal)

5. Modern Cognitive Theories
   ├── Bialystok (2009, 2010)
   │   ├── Better cognitive control
   │   ├── Multitasking, attention switching
   │   └── Delay in dementia symptoms (by 4–5 years)

6. Types of Bilinguals
   ├── Balanced Bilingual – equal in both languages
   ├── Ambilingual – fully fluent in both (rare)
   ├── Receptive Bilingual – understands but can't speak
   ├── Productive Bilingual – can speak and write
   ├── Additive Bilingualism – new language adds skills
   └── Subtractive Bilingualism – new language replaces old
       └── Example: Hindi fluency loss after English-medium schooling

7. Language Acquisition
   ├── Natural Acquisition
   │   └── Example: Learning Hindi at home/community
   ├── School-based Acquisition
   │   └── Example: French in school
   └── Success depends on:
       ├── Motivation
       ├── Aptitude
       └── Opportunity

8. Beyond Language: Cognitive Benefits
   ├── Improved memory
   ├── Better executive function
   ├── Delay in cognitive decline
   └── Cultural flexibility

9. Language Mixing Phenomena
   ├── Code-Switching
   │   └── Example: “Main aaunga after lunch.”
   ├── Cross-Language Interference
   │   └── Example: “I am going market.” (Hindi influence)
   └── Transfer Effects
       └── Example: French spelling patterns affect English

10. Language and Identity
    ├── Language = culture, values, emotion
    ├── Grosjean (1982): different self in each language
    │   └── Example: confident in English, emotional in Hindi
    └── Language as political identity
        └── Example: Bangladesh and the Bengali language movement

Essay Questions (Related Areas)
├── Role of Proficiency & unreliability of self-assessment

   │   └── Mid-sentence shift (e.g., "phir ghar aaya")
   └── Code-Mixing
       └── Borrowing words (e.g., "Yeh assignment kal submit karna")

8. Summary Concepts Table
   ├── Universal Grammar – All languages share core rules
   ├── Diglossia – High/low function languages
   ├── Areal Classification – Geographic influence
   ├── Critical Period – Ideal age for language learning

│
├── 🍼 Introduction: Studying Infant Language
│   ├── Data collection is indirect
│   ├── Must infer from behavior
│   ├── Harder in multilingual contexts (multiple systems)
│
├── 🎯 Key Challenges in Acquisition

LANGUAGE ACQUISITION IN INFANTS (BI/MULTILINGUAL) – II
│
├── 📌 CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION
│   ├── Infants perceive phonemic contrasts (e.g., /b/ vs /p/)
│   ├── Tested by Eimas et al. (1971) using HAS paradigm
│   ├── Result: Infants noticed change across VOT boundary
│   └── Conclusion: Speech perception ability is innate
│
├── 🌐 CROSS-LINGUISTIC INSIGHTS
│   ├── Lisker & Abramson (1964): VOT boundaries vary by language
│   ├── Lasky et al. (1975): <7-month-olds perceive all phonemes
│   └── Perception declines without exposure to non-native languages
│
├── 🕰️ DEVELOPMENT TIMELINE (Kuhl, 2004)
│   ├── <6 months: Universal phoneme perception
│   ├── 6–9 months: Decline in non-native perception begins
│   ├── ~9 months: Native phonotactics start emerging
│   └── ~11 months: Non-native consonant perception mostly gone
│
├── 🔍 PERCEPTUAL REORGANIZATION
│   ├── Experience-dependent process
│   ├── Native language contrast detection improves
│   └── Non-native contrast perception fades with age
│
├── ❓ KEY QUESTIONS (De Groot, 2011)
│   ├── When does non-native contrast loss begin?
│   ├── How long to master native contrasts?
│   └── Is the decline different for bilinguals vs monolinguals?

│       └── Non-native phonemes mapped to native categories
│
└── 📌 SUMMARY
    ├── Categorical perception is foundational
    ├── Native contrast perception improves with age
    ├── Non-native contrast perception declines

```text
Language Acquisition in Bi/Multilinguals – III
│
├── 1. Phonemic Development
│   ├── Native language phoneme perception ↑ with age
│   └── Non-native phoneme perception ↓ with age
│
├── 2. Sequential Bilingualism
│   ├── Second language learned after first
│   ├── Brain becomes language-specific before L2
│   └── Harder to acquire new phonemes (e.g., Japanese /l/ vs /r/)
│
│   └── Study: Kuhl et al. (2003)
│       ├── English infants exposed to Mandarin
│       ├── Live interaction enabled phoneme learning
│       └── Audio/video exposure failed to produce same effect
│
├── 3. Simultaneous Bilingualism
│   ├── Two languages from birth
│   ├── Brain processes two phonetic systems at once
│   └── Uses statistical learning to form phoneme categories
│
│   └── Study: Maye et al. (2002, 2006)
│       ├── Bimodal input → 2 phoneme categories
│       └── Unimodal input → 1 phoneme category
│
│   └── Study: Bosch & Sebastian-Galles (2003)
│       ├── Tested Catalan-Spanish infants (4, 8, 12 months)
│       ├── Sound: /e/ in "bait" vs /ɛ/ in "bet"
│       ├── 8-month bilinguals failed to perceive contrast
│       └── 12-month bilinguals regained ability
│
├── 4. Influence of Cross-Language Overlap
│   ├── Similar sounds between languages delay contrast development
│   └── May form single category due to overlap
│
├── 5. Frequency of Exposure
│   ├── Frequent hearing of phonemes → better distinction
│   └── Interaction between distribution and frequency
│
│   └── Study: Sundara et al. (2008)
│       ├── French-English bilingual infants
│       ├── Discriminated English /d/ vs French /d/
│       └── Frequency overcomes distributional overlap
│
└── 6. Summary Points
    ├── Simultaneous bilinguals = slower but successful phonemic development
    ├── Cross-language distribution delays development
    └── Frequency and interaction play critical roles

Language Acquisition in Bi/Multilinguals – IV
│
├── 1. Word Learning Begins
│   ├── After phoneme learning
│   ├── Infants must solve:
│   │   └── The Segmentation Problem (identifying word boundaries)
│   └── Speech is a continuous stream (no pauses between words)
│
├── 2. Word Segmentation Mechanism
│   └── Statistical Learning
│       ├── Infants track patterns and transitional probabilities between syllables
│       └── Helps recognize word-like units
│
├── 3. Key Experiments
│   ├── Jusczyk & Aslin (1995)
│   │   ├── 7.5-month-olds recognize familiar words in fluent speech
│   │   └── 6-month-olds fail → skill develops between 6–7.5 months
│   │
│   ├── Saffran et al. (1996)
│   │   ├── Exposed to 2 min of fluent nonsense speech
│   │   ├── Words: pabiku, tibudo, etc.
│   │   └── Result: Infants use syllable transition probabilities to segment words
│   │
│   └── Saffran (2001)
│       ├── Infants treat statistical words as real words
│       └── Listen longer in real sentence context
│
├── 4. Phonotactics
│   ├── Definition: Legal sound combinations in a language
│   ├── Jusczyk et al. (1993): 9-month-olds prefer native language word lists
│   └── Catalan vs. Spanish Study (Sebastian-Galles & Bosch, 2002)
│       ├── Catalan allows CC clusters; Spanish doesn’t
│       ├── Catalan infants prefer legal clusters
│       └── Spanish infants show no preference
│
├── 5. Bilingual Infant Learning
│   ├── Catalan-Spanish bilinguals tested:
│   │   ├── Catalan-dominant
│   │   └── Spanish-dominant
│   ├── Outcomes considered:
│   │   ├── Exposure alone → all bilinguals match Catalan monolinguals
│   │   ├── Amount of exposure → more exposure = more learning
│   │   └── Dominance → only dominant language develops phonotactic sensitivity
│   └── Result: Dominance matters
│       └── Catalan-dominant = Catalan monolinguals
│
└── 6. Summary Points
    ├── Infants can segment speech using statistical learning
    ├── Recognize syllable patterns before 1 year
    ├── Phonotactic knowledge develops by 10 months
    ├── Bilingualism does not delay learning
    └── Language dominance affects phonotactic sensitivity more than bilingualism
```
