## üß† MAIN THEME: **From Sounds to Words in Infants**

This lecture focuses on how infants move beyond learning sounds (phonemes) to learning **words**, especially in the context of growing up bilingual.

---

## üî∏ 1. The Word Segmentation Problem

### üí¨ What is it?

* Speech is a **continuous stream** ‚Äî there are no clear pauses between words in natural speech.
* It's **hard to know where one word ends and the next begins**‚Äîespecially for babies just learning a language.

> üß† Try listening to a foreign language movie. It all sounds like one long sentence!

---

## üî∏ 2. Challenge for Infants

* Infants must:

  1. **Break speech into individual words** (segmenting),
  2. Then **associate words with meanings**.

Yet, they **don‚Äôt get pauses or clear markers** to help them out.

---

## üî∏ 3. The ‚ÄúWord Spurt‚Äù

* Around **18 months of age**, babies experience a **vocabulary explosion**.
* But before that, they slowly learn to recognize repeated word patterns.

---

## üîπ SOLUTION: **Statistical Learning**

Infants **track regularities** in what they hear.

> üéØ Idea: Certain syllables **always follow each other** (within words), while others don‚Äôt.

### Example:

* In the nonsense word ‚Äúpabiku‚Äù:

  * *Pa ‚Üí bi ‚Üí ku* = High transitional probability
* But *ku ‚Üí ti* (from a different word) = Low probability

---

## üî∏ 4. Key Experiments

### ‚úÖ **Jusczyk & Aslin (1995)**

* 7.5-month-old babies listened longer to words they had **heard before** in isolation.
* 6-month-olds **could not do this** ‚Üí Skill develops between 6‚Äì7.5 months.

### ‚úÖ **Saffran et al. (1996)**

* Used **continuous nonsense speech**: ‚Äúpabiku tibudo golatu dorapi‚Äù.
* No pauses or stress cues.
* Infants still **figured out word boundaries** using syllable patterns.

> üß† Conclusion: Babies use **statistical probabilities** to segment speech.

---

### ‚úÖ **Saffran (2001)**: Are ‚Äúnonsense words‚Äù treated as real words?

* Presented the learned nonsense words in:

  1. **Real English sentences**: ‚ÄúWhat a nice *pabiku*!‚Äù
  2. **Nonsense sentences**: ‚ÄúZy fike ny *pabiku*.‚Äù

* Babies listened **longer to the real context** ‚Üí treated *pabiku* like a real word!

---

## üî∏ 5. Phonotactics and Real Languages

### ‚úÖ **Jusczyk et al. (1993)**

* 9-month-old English and Dutch infants listened longer to **word lists from their native language**.

> üìå Shows: Babies detect language-specific sound patterns.

---

### ‚úÖ **Sebastian-Galles & Bosch (2002)**

* Tested Catalan vs. Spanish babies using **legal vs. illegal** word endings.

> Example:

* Catalan allows CC endings like ‚Äúbirt‚Äù but not ‚Äúketr‚Äù.
* Spanish doesn‚Äôt allow either.

**Findings**:

* Catalan babies preferred **legal Catalan** endings.
* Spanish babies had **no preference**.
* **Catalan-Spanish bilinguals** showed **preference only if Catalan was dominant**.

> üîë Conclusion: **Language dominance** affects phonotactic learning.

## üìå KEY TAKEAWAYS (Summary)

| Concept                  | Explanation                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Segmentation problem** | Speech lacks clear word boundaries; infants must find words in fluent speech. |
| **Statistical learning** | Infants track syllable patterns to identify word boundaries.                  |
| **Phonotactics**         | Knowledge of allowable sound combinations in a language.                      |
| **Language dominance**   | Infants exposed more to one language show stronger learning in that language. |

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è EXAMPLES TO REMEMBER

* **"pabiku" test** ‚Üí babies track syllables to find words.
* **Catalan vs. Spanish CC clusters** ‚Üí dominant language shapes phonotactic learning.
* **English sentence vs. nonsense sentence** ‚Üí babies treat statistically learned words as meaningful.

## üìù ESSAY/PRACTICE QUESTIONS

---

### **1. What is the segmentation problem in language acquisition, and how do infants solve it?**

**Hints:**

* Explain lack of word boundaries in speech.
* Mention statistical learning and transitional probabilities.
* Use Jusczyk, Saffran‚Äôs studies as evidence.

---

### **2. How does statistical learning help infants in word acquisition?**

**Hints:**

* Define statistical learning.
* Saffran et al. study on nonsense words.
* Role of syllable patterns in identifying word boundaries.

---

### **3. Do bilingual infants develop phonotactic knowledge differently from monolinguals? Discuss with evidence.**

**Hints:**

* Define phonotactics.
* Mention Sebastian-Galles & Bosch‚Äôs study.
* Role of language dominance vs. mere exposure.

---

### **4. How early can infants recognize words or word-like units in fluent speech?**

**Hints:**

* Jusczyk & Aslin‚Äôs study (7.5-month-olds recognize familiar words).
* Discuss how this ability is missing in 6-month-olds.

---

### **5. What does research say about whether bilingualism delays phonotactic development in infants?**

**Hints:**

* Sebastian-Galles & Bosch bilingual study.
* Explain that **language dominance** matters, not bilingualism alone.
