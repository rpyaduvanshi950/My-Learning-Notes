      <h3><b>Travelogue : Khatling Trek ( October 9th - 16th, 2005) </b></h3>

    <p><b>Day Zero : </b></p>
    <p>All of us were in SAC, getting ready 
    to leave. For some of us, the mid semester exams had just ended in the 
    afternoon, and we were frantically packing our rucksacks, as the plan 
    was to leave by 17:30 hrs. Our original plan was to go to the base of a 
    peak called Deo Tibba ,in Himachal Pradesh. The peak is at an altitude 
    of 6000 m, and we planned to trek till 4800m. However, there had been an 
    earthquake that morning with the epicentre in POK, and this quake had an 
    effect in Himachal Pradesh as well .So, the Dean of Student's Affairs, 
    after speaking to the parents of some students going on the trek, 
    advised us not to go to Deo Tibba. My worst fear was that the plan would 
    be cancelled and we would have to stay in Kanpur for a whole week !That 
    would have been awful, considering that all my wingmates had already 
    left for home. Bhuts (Gaurav Bhutani, our team leader and coordinator of 
    the Adventure Club) informed us at around 15:00 hours that the trek 
    would have to be cancelled,and that he would try his best to form a 
    backup plan. Within half an hour, he decided that we would go on another 
    trek that he had considered earlier : the trek to Khatling glacier, 
    Uttaranchal, in the Garwhal Himalaya, which is quite far from the 
    epicentre.We decided to leave at around 20:00 hours from the campus. 
    Since we did not have train reservation, we went from Kanpur to Bareilly 
    by bus (around eleven hours) and from there to Dehradun (took us around 
    twelve hours from Bareilly.) </p>
    <p><b>Day One : </b></p>
    <p>The Dehradun bus terminus was modern 
    and very tourist friendly - we stayed for the night in tourist 
    accommodation at the terminus - pretty decent. It was good to sleep in a 
    firm, stationary bed after nearly twenty four hours in the bus ! The bus 
    journey itself was pretty good fun, since we were such a large group 
    (nineteen) </p>
    <p><b>Day Two :</b> </p>
    <p>After picking up some new rucksacks 
    from Dehradun, we left for Gutthu in two jeeps. Gutthu was to be the 
    starting point of our trek. On the way to Gutthu, we passed through 
    Tehri - where the Tehri Dam Project is going on. Had a look at all the 
    houses that had to be abandoned because of the project - they had 
    deteriorated to such an extent that it looked as if they had been 
    through a natural disaster. Stopped at a nice little restaurant for 
    lunch - and had fun with in the river flowing just behind it. We reached 
    Gutthu by 18:00 hours. Quite a few people threw up on the way, and 
    surprisingly, I did not (I have a history of motion sickness !) It was a 
    bit chill in Gutthu. The Belengana river, whose source is the Khatling 
    glacier, flows through the town. The river was with us for most of the 
    trek, though at some points we were far above it. <br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <p>The whole town had a blackout and the 
    only light available was candlelight. There was no pollution and no 
    interfering light so I could see an amazing number of stars - it was 
    breath taking. I finally understood what "star-studded sky" meant. We 
    had dinner at a really small shop with just a candle to provide light 
    and it was great. After dinner we went for a stroll. There was a bridge 
    over the river and as we stood on the bridge, there was a really bright 
    moon above, the star-studded sky and the water of the Belengana was 
    gushing below, the foam glistening in the moonlight. It was so serene 
    and beautiful. Pity there was no way I could photograph it, and even if 
    I could, there was no way it could capture the magic of the moment. I'm 
    not much of a poet, but the scene almost made me one.</p>
    <p><b>Day Three :</b> </p>
    <p>We started our trek from Gutthu at 
    around 09:20 hours. Beyond Gutthu, there were no phone lines so we were 
    cut-off from civilisation in some sense. FM radio signals were not very 
    strong in Gutthu, but beyond Gutthu the reception was surprisingly good 
    - because of a telecommunication tower maintained by the ITBP 
    (Indo-Tibetan Border police.)</p>
    <p>For most of the first day's trek, the 
    river was flowing alongside. We went through dense forest - crossing 
    several small streams on the way. Halfway through the trek it started 
    raining very heavily - didn't last too long, but it caused a dip in 
    temperature and also made us feel like we were in a rainforest ;-) At 
    some points we were enveloped by greenery on all sides - only the trail 
    was barren.</p>
    <p>The first day was largely 
    uneventfulâ€¦and we reached Reeh by around 15:30 hours, after covering ten 
    kilometres. </p>
    <p><b>Day Four :</b></p>
    <p>Rhee is surrounded on all sides by 
    mountains - it felt great to wake up and have a look around. The second 
    day's trek was the hardest - the first hour and half being specially 
    steep and tiring. After that it was still tough, but quite not as bad. 
    There was a beautiful, plain trail passing right across the faces of 
    adjacent mountains. These mountains were covered with lush grass and 
    with a few trees here and there. We passed a heard of mountain goats as 
    well - the kids of the herd were amazingly cute.</p>
    <p>Our next stop was at Gangi - a really 
    beautiful place surrounded by snow-capped peaks.</p>
    <p><b>Day Five :</b></p>
    <p>Very interesting day's trek. Saw my 
    first landslide on this day - the whole face of the mountain had become 
    like one huge inclined plane - pretty steep too. There were two 
    landslides, very close to each other, right in the middle of our path. 
    Within minutes of seeing my first landslide, I had to cross it ! We had 
    to walk right across it - this was difficult for several reasons - 
    balancing a pretty heavy rucksack, for one. I made the mistake of 
    looking down and the sight of the river gushing away to glory below was 
    not very encouraging ;-) </p>
    <p>But the scariest part is when you put 
    your foot on a stone, and it starts wobbling, or worse, slides down into 
    the river ! Anyway, I was pretty nervous while crossing the landslides.
    </p>
    <p>In the afternoon we stopped for a 
    couple of hours on the riverside after a fair bit of descent. There were 
    the usual pebbles on the river side, and quite a few big rocks as well. 
    There were a few spots where the rocks and pebbles had been ground to 
    really fine grains of sand and this was really beautiful. This place 
    where we stopped was really serene - the mountains, the river, the 
    rocks, the pebbles, the sun, the sand. No other sound but that of the 
    frothy river flowing. <br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Then we began our ascent and the last 
    one hour or so was very steep and tiring. Finally, we reached our 
    campsite (Kalyani) in the afternoon, and set up our tents. This place 
    was just a (fairly large) clearing in the forest. The porters warned us 
    that bears and tigers might be around and that we must be very careful, 
    specially while venturing out at night.They said that about a couple of 
    days ago a tiger had killed a buffalo there. <br>
    We sat huddled around a campfire for most of the evening, and cooked 
    over one as well. It was great fun - and atleast for me, a totally new 
    experience.</p>
    <p><b>Day Six :</b></p>
    <p>The first thing I saw after stepping 
    out of our tent in the morning was the frost on the ground - indicating 
    that the temperature must have been well below zero the previous night. 
    On walking around a bit, we saw the pug marks of a bear as well - 
    leading into the jungle. Our original plan was to spread our descent to 
    Gutthu over two days - days six and seven. However, here we decided to 
    go on a hike to a nearby peak and <br>
    then compress our descent to day seven. I was a bit apprehensive about 
    this idea because that meant descending twenty eight kilometres in one 
    day ! </p>
    <p>We left our rucksacks in the tents and 
    this made our hike a lot easier. We did not have a very well-defined 
    trail this time and just climbed up a (pretty steep!) mountain face. We 
    went through thick vegetation as well. At the top we had a really good 
    view of the snow-capped peaks surrounding our campsite - would have been 
    even better if only there had been fewer clouds though ;-(<br>
    Soon, we began our descent to the campsite - since it was very muddy, 
    slippery and steep it was good fun - practically slid down to the 
    campsite ;-) </p>
    <p><b>Day Seven :</b></p>
    <p>Started at 09:00 hours in the morning. 
    Had to cross the two landslides we crossed while on our way up - only 
    this time I had absolutely no problems whatsoever. I knew that even if I 
    slipped, I woudn't keep on sliding, I'd be able hold onto some rock 
    anyway. So the worst thing that could happen was that I could get 
    bruised ;-) Once I understood this crossing the landslide was no big 
    deal.Descending is much faster than ascending, though it does exert the 
    knees a bit, specially if its very steep. We reached Gangi at around 
    11:30 hours and <br>
    Rhee by 15:00 hours. Managed to reach Gutthu in one piece by 18:30 
    hours, although my legs weren't too happy with me. Made one phone call 
    to tell my family that I was fine.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Day Eight and after :</b></p>
    <p>We started from Gutthu by bus at 
    around 07:30 hours and reached Dehradun by the evening, from where we 
    caught a train to Lucknow. Reached Lucknow at around 08:30 hours, and 
    was in campus by noon.</p>
    <p>To sum up - <i>"What a pityâ€¦ to see 
    the view, one has to climb the mountain !!!"</i></p>
