**Variable Covalency in Halogens (Group 17 Elements)**

- **Definition of Covalency**  
  - Covalency is the number of electron pairs an atom shares when it forms covalent bonds.  
  - “Variable covalency” means an element can form different numbers of bonds (different valencies) in different compounds.

- **Trend Down the Group**  
  - As you go from fluorine (F) → chlorine (Cl) → bromine (Br) → iodine (I), the *maximum* covalency increases.  
  - Fluorine: covalency = 1  
  - Chlorine: up to 7 in some compounds  
  - Bromine/Iodine: similarly show multiple valencies (1, 3, 5, 7)

- **Primary Reason: Availability of d-Orbitals**  
  - Period 2 elements (like F) have only 2s and 2p orbitals in the valence shell—no vacant d-orbitals → octet cannot expand.  
    - Fluorine can only accommodate 8 electrons total (2s² 2p⁵) → forms at most one bond → valency = 1.  
  - Period 3 and beyond (Cl, Br, I) introduce vacant d-orbitals in the valence shell:  
    - Chlorine: vacant 3d orbitals  
    - Bromine: vacant 4d orbitals  
    - Iodine: vacant 5d orbitals  
  - These vacant d-orbitals allow the atom to “borrow” extra orbitals, expanding its octet.

- **How d-Orbitals Enable Octet Expansion**  
  - **Electron Promotion & Hybridization**  
    - An electron from a filled p-orbital can be promoted to an empty d-orbital.  
    - The atom then hybridizes (e.g., `sp³d²`, `sp³d³`) to accommodate more bonding pairs.  
  - **Result:** Formation of compounds with covalencies greater than 1.

- **Key Examples of Variable Covalency in Chlorine**  
  - `HCl`  → covalency 1  (linear molecule)  
  - `ClF₃` → covalency 3  (T-shaped structure)  
  - `ClF₅` → covalency 5  (square pyramidal)  
  - `ClF₇` → covalency 7  (pentagonal bipyramidal)  

- **Why the Tendency Increases Down the Group**  
  1. **Larger Atomic Size**  
     - Valence electrons are farther from the nucleus → held less tightly → easier to promote electrons to higher orbitals.  
  2. **Smaller Energy Gap between p and d Orbitals**  
     - In heavier halogens, the energy difference (ΔE) between the valence p orbitals and the empty d orbitals decreases → promotion requires less energy.  
  3. **Greater Number of Available d-Orbitals**  
     - More “slots” to accommodate bonding pairs → more possible covalent bonds.

- **Implications of Variable Covalency**  
  - **Oxidation States:** Heavier halogens can exhibit oxidation states of +1, +3, +5, +7 in oxyacids and halogen fluorides.  
  - **Reactivity & Bonding Patterns:** Knowledge of variable covalency helps predict molecular shapes, bond angles, and reactivity in halogen-containing compounds.

- **Summary**  
  - Down Group 17, elements acquire vacant d-orbitals, enabling octet expansion.  
  - Fluorine is strictly monovalent; Cl, Br, I can be multivalent (up to 7).  
  - Atomic size increase and reduced p–d energy gaps facilitate higher covalencies.

**Fajans’ Rules — Predicting Covalent vs Ionic Character**

- **Purpose of Fajans’ Rules**  
  - To estimate whether a bond in a “formally ionic” compound behaves more *ionic* or more *covalent*.  
  - Focuses on the *polarization* of the anion by the cation.

- **Key Concepts**  
  - **Polarizing Power (of the cation):** Ability to distort (polarize) the electron cloud of the anion.  
  - **Polarizability (of the anion):** Ease with which the anion’s electron cloud can be distorted.

- **The Three Fajans’ Rules**  
  1. **Size of Ions**  
     - Small cation + large anion → high polarization → bond has greater covalent character.  
     - Large cation + small anion → less polarization → bond is more ionic.  
  2. **Charge on Ions**  
     - Higher charges → greater polarizing/polarizable effect → more covalent character.  
       - E.g., `Al³⁺` distorts `Cl⁻` more than `Na⁺` distorts `Cl⁻`.  
  3. **Electronic Configuration of the Cation**  
     - Cations with “pseudo-noble-gas” configurations (e.g., filled d or f subshells) polarize anions more effectively than those with true noble-gas configurations.  
     - A cation lacking fully filled inner shells is more polarizing.

- **How Polarization Leads to Covalent Character**  
  - The cation’s electric field pulls the anion’s electron cloud toward itself → partial sharing of electrons.  
  - This distortion reduces the purely ionic nature and increases charge sharing (covalency).

- **Illustrative Examples**  
  - **`NaCl` vs `LiI`**  
    - `Li⁺` (small) + `I⁻` (large) → significant polarization → `LiI` has more covalent character than `NaCl`.  
  - **`AlCl₃` vs `NaCl`**  
    - `Al³⁺` (high charge, small radius) strongly polarizes `Cl⁻` → `AlCl₃` shows considerable covalent bonding, even being a molecular solid.

- **Applications of Fajans’ Rules**  
  - Rationalizing melting points, solubilities, electrical conductivities of salts.  
  - Predicting whether a new compound will be brittle ionic or soft with directional covalent bonds.

- **Summary**  
  - Small, highly charged cations + large, easily polarizable anions → shift toward covalency.  
  - Fajans’ Rules provide a quick, qualitative way to predict bonding character based on simple ionic properties.

**Polarizing Power & Polarisability**  
- **Key Idea**: A cation can distort (polarize) the electron cloud of an anion.  
  - The degree of distortion correlates with covalent character in an “ionic” bond.  
  - More distortion → greater sharing of electron density → higher covalent character.

---

**Fajans’ Rules (Factors Increasing Covalent Character)**  
Fajans’ rules help predict when an “ionic” compound will exhibit significant covalent character. Three main factors:

1. **Small Size & High Charge of the Cation** *(High Polarizing Power)*  
   - A small cation with a high positive charge generates a strong electric field.  
     - This strong field pulls on the valence electrons of the anion, distorting its electron cloud.  
   - Consequence: Electron density shifts toward the cation, increasing electron sharing.  
   - Example:  
     - `Al3+` vs. `Na+`  
       - `Al3+` radius ≈ 50 pm (small) with +3 charge → very strong polarizing power  
       - `Na+` radius ≈ 102 pm with +1 charge → weaker polarizing power  
     - Result: AlCl₃ exhibits more covalent character than NaCl.

2. **Large Size & High Charge of the Anion** *(High Polarisability)*  
   - A large anion has its outer electrons farther from the nucleus and more shielded.  
     - These electrons are more easily distorted by the cation’s electric field.  
   - Consequence: Greater distortion of the anion’s electron cloud → more covalent character.  
   - Example:  
     - `I–` vs. `F–`  
       - Ionic radius of `I–` ≈ 220 pm (large), electrons loosely held  
       - Ionic radius of `F–` ≈ 133 pm (smaller), electrons more tightly held  
     - Result: AgI is more covalent than AgF because `I–` is more polarisable.

3. **Cation Without Noble Gas Configuration**  
   - If a cation lacks a full noble gas electron configuration, its inner shells shield less effectively.  
     - Particularly true for transition metal cations with a pseudo-noble gas configuration (e.g., d^10).  
   - Poor shielding → higher effective nuclear charge felt by anion electrons → greater polarizing power.  
   - Example:  
     - `Cu+` ([Ar] 3d^10) vs. `K+` ([Ar])  
       - Both have electron counts similar to Ar, but `Cu+` has filled 3d orbitals that do not shield as well.  
       - `Cu+` therefore polarizes anions more strongly than `K+`.

---

**Examples Applying Fajans’ Rules**  
- **NaCl vs. AlCl₃**  
  - NaCl:  
    - `Na+` is large (+1 charge) → low polarizing power  
    - `Cl–` is moderately sized → moderate polarisability  
    - Result: Predominantly ionic bonding.  
  - AlCl₃:  
    - `Al3+` is small with +3 charge → very high polarizing power  
    - Distorts `Cl–` electron clouds significantly  
    - Result: Substantial covalent character; AlCl₃ is often described as covalent or covalent network-like.

- **AgF vs. AgI**  
  - AgF:  
    - `F–` small → low polarisability  
    - `Ag+` moderate polarizing power  
    - Result: More ionic.  
  - AgI:  
    - `I–` large → high polarisability  
    - `Ag+` same polarizing power as in AgF  
    - Result: More covalent character compared to AgF.

---

**Link to Halogens & Variable Covalency**  
- Heavier halogens (Cl, Br, I) have larger atomic radii and more diffuse electron clouds.  
  - Increased polarisability enables them to form compounds with expanded octets and covalent bonds.  
- Common high-oxidation-state halogen compounds:  
  - `ClF3`, `BrF5`, `IF7`  
    - Here, halogen acts as the central atom sharing electrons covalently with fluorine atoms.  
- Fajans’ rules predict:
  - Large, highly charged halogen central atoms distort F– electron clouds less (F– is small), but the halogen’s own size allows it to expand its valence shell (d-orbitals) and form covalent bonds.

---

**Study Notes Summary**  
- **Polarizing Power**: Cation’s ability to attract and distort anion electrons; increases with smaller size and higher charge.  
- **Polarisability**: Anion’s ease of distortion; increases with larger size and more diffuse electron cloud.  
- **Shielding & Electron Configuration**: Transition metal cations with incomplete shielding (d-orbitals) polarize more.  
- **Predictive Use**:  
  - Compare cation sizes/charges and anion sizes to estimate ionic vs. covalent character.  
  - Use examples like NaCl vs. AlCl₃ and AgF vs. AgI for practice.  
- **Extension to Main Group Chemistry**:  
  - Heavier elements (e.g., Cl, Br, I) form covalent, often hypervalent compounds due to high polarisability and available d-orbitals.

Keep these points in mind to analyze bonding character in inorganic compounds effectively!

**Thermodynamics vs. Kinetics**  
- **Spontaneity and Gibbs Free Energy**  
  - A reaction is **thermodynamically spontaneous** if its change in Gibbs free energy, `ΔG`, is negative (`ΔG < 0`).  
    - `ΔG = ΔH – TΔS`  
      - `ΔH` = enthalpy change  
      - `ΔS` = entropy change  
      - `T` = absolute temperature  
  - Even if `ΔG` is highly negative (strong driving force), the reaction may not proceed unless the **kinetic barrier** is overcome.  

- **Activation Energy (`Ea`)**  
  - Defined as the minimum energy barrier reactants must surmount to form products.  
  - **High `Ea`**  
    - Slows the rate dramatically  
    - Can “stop” or greatly retard a reaction despite negative `ΔG`  
  - **Low `Ea`**  
    - Promotes fast reaction rates  
    - Cannot “stop” a spontaneous reaction; rather, it accelerates it  

- **Entropy vs. Enthalpy Misconception**  
  - Option b (*“Entropy larger than Enthalpy”*) is misleading: `ΔS` and `ΔH` enter the free‐energy equation differently (`TΔS` term). You cannot compare them directly without `T`.  

- **Correct Answer**:  
  - **(c) High activation energy** can prevent a thermodynamically favorable (large negative `ΔG`) reaction from occurring at an observable rate.  

---

**Coordinate Covalent vs. Covalent Bonding**  
- **Covalent Bond**  
  - Each atom contributes one electron to the shared pair.  
  - Example: In `H–H`, each H atom donates one `1s` electron.  

- **Coordinate (Dative) Covalent Bond**  
  - One atom donates **both** electrons of the bond pair; the other atom contributes none.  
  - Still represented as a single bond in Lewis structures, but often with an arrow pointing from donor to acceptor:  
    - e.g. `NH₃ → BF₃` forms `H₃N→BF₃`  
      - N donates its lone pair to the empty `p` orbital on B  
  - **Key Difference**: Origin of the electron pair  

---

**Solubility of SnCl₂ vs. SnCl₄**  
- **SnCl₂**  
  - Tin is in the +2 oxidation state; compound has significant ionic character.  
  - Dissolves in water by hydrating `Sn²⁺` and `Cl⁻` ions.  

- **SnCl₄**  
  - Tin is in the +4 oxidation state; compound is **covalent** and polarized.  
  - Undergoes **hydrolysis** rather than simple dissolution:  
    - Forms `SnO₂·nH₂O` (a polymeric solid) and releases HCl.  
  - Lacks free `Cl⁻` in solution, so “does not dissolve” like a salt.  

---

**Cation Polarization in CsF**  
- **Polarization** = distortion of anion electron cloud by the cation’s electric field.  
- Depends on charge density: `z/r²` (charge/ionic radius²)  
  - **Cs⁺**: large radius, +1 charge → **low** polarization power  
  - **F⁻**: small radius, high electron density, but Cs⁺ cannot pull enough to distort appreciably  
- Result: **Purely ionic** lattice, minimal covalent character, no visible polarization  

---

**Lewis Structures: Foundation for VBT & MOT**  
- **Basic Rules**  
  1. **Electron Pairing**: A bond forms when two nuclei share (pair) two electrons.  
  2. **Octet Rule (2nd Period)**: Most atoms strive for 8 valence electrons.  
     - Exceptions exist for elements beyond the 2nd period.  
  3. **Electron Deficiency (<4 valence electrons)**: Elements like B, Be cannot complete an octet in simple molecules.  
  4. **Expanded Octets**: Elements with **low‐lying empty orbitals** (e.g. P, S, Xe) can exceed 8 electrons (e.g. `PCl₅`, `SF₆`).  

- **Questions on Electron Deficiency and Expansion**  
  - Can `BCl₃` form a dimer?  
    - No, because Cl is too electronegative to donate back into B’s empty `p` orbital (poor back‐bonding).  
  - Why does `BeCl₂` polymerize in the solid state?  
    - Be²⁺ has empty `2p` orbitals; bridging `Cl⁻` donate electron density, forming a chain (polymer).  

- **Back‐Bonding**  
  - Occurs when a filled lone‐pair orbital on a ligand donates into an empty metal (or main‐group) orbital.  
  - **Absent in `BeCl₂`**: Electron density strongly polarized toward Cl; Be has no filled orbitals to back‐donate.  

---

**Dimerization: `BH₃` vs. `BCl₃`**  
- **`BH₃`**  
  - Electron‐deficient, features an empty `2p` orbital on B.  
  - `H₂B–H–BH₂` bridging H atoms form `B₂H₆` (diborane) to satisfy each B’s electron deficiency.  

- **`BCl₃`**  
  - Also electron‐deficient, but Cl is much more electronegative.  
  - Cl’s lone pairs are held tightly; poor orbital overlap with B’s `2p`.  
  - No stable bridging structure ⇒ remains monomeric in the gas phase.  

- **Replacing Cl with H**  
  - Increases B–ligand bond covalency and orbital overlap  
  - Promotes dimerization as in `B₂H₆`  

---

**Resonance and Canonical Structures**  
- **Canonical (Resonance) Structures**  
  - Alternative Lewis structures that differ only in electron placement, not atom positions.  
  - Real molecule is a **hybrid** of these structures.  
  - Example: `O₃` has two resonance forms with different positions of the double bond.  

---

**Formal Charge vs. Oxidation State**  
- **Formal Charge (FC)**  
  - Assumes equal sharing of electrons in bonds.  
  - Calculation for atom X:  
    ```
    FC = (valence e⁻ of X) – [nonbonding e⁻ + ½ bonding e⁻]
    ```  
  - Helps identify the most plausible Lewis structure (minimize |FC|).  

- **Oxidation State (OS)**  
  - Electrons in each bond assigned to the **more electronegative** atom.  
  - Often used in redox reactions.  
  - Can differ from FC, especially in polar covalent bonds (e.g. in `H–F`: FC(H)=0, OS(H)=+1).  

By understanding these core concepts—thermodynamics vs. kinetics, types of bonding, Lewis rules, electron deficiency, dimerization, and charge assignments—students build a solid foundation in inorganic chemistry and are better prepared for advanced topics like Valence Bond Theory (VBT) and Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT).

**1. Formal Charge (FC) vs. Oxidation State (OS)**  
*(Key Differences & Calculation of FC)*

- **Why distinguish FC and OS?**  
  - FC assumes *equal sharing* of bonding electrons.  
  - OS assigns electrons *completely* to the more electronegative atom in each bond.  
  - → FC is a bookkeeping tool to compare resonance structures; OS tracks *electron flow* in redox chemistry.

- **Formal Charge (Q<sub>F</sub>):**  
  - Definition: the charge an atom would have if all bonds were purely covalent (i.e. electrons in bonds are shared equally).  
  - Use to identify the “best” Lewis structure (minimize formal charges, place negative FC on more electronegative atoms).

- **Calculation Formula**  
  ```  
  QF = NVE – NNB – (NB / 2)  
  ```  
  Where:  
  - `NVE` = Number of valence electrons in the *free* (neutral) atom.  
  - `NNB` = Number of *non-bonding* electrons (lone-pair electrons) on that atom in the molecule.  
  - `NB`  = Number of *bonding* electrons assigned in bonds to that atom (total electrons in bonds around the atom).

- **Step-by-Step Calculation**  
  1. **Count NVE**: look up the group number in the periodic table.  
     - Ex: N in group 15 → NVE = 5.  
  2. **Count NNB**: each lone pair contributes 2 non-bonding electrons.  
     - Ex: in NH<sub>3</sub>, N has one lone pair → NNB = 2.  
  3. **Count NB**: each single bond contributes 2 electrons, a double bond 4, etc.; but all go *around* the atom.  
     - Ex: NH<sub>3</sub> has three N–H bonds → NB = 3 bonds × 2 e⁻ = 6.  
  4. **Plug into formula**:  
     ```  
     QF (on N in NH3) = 5 – 2 – (6/2)  
                     = 5 – 2 – 3  
                     = 0  
     ```

- **Example: Formal Charge in CO₂**  
  - Structure: O=C=O.  
  - For central C: NVE = 4; NNB = 0; NB = (2 double bonds) × 4 e⁻ each = 8 →  
    ```  
    QF(C) = 4 – 0 – (8/2) = 4 – 0 – 4 = 0  
    ```  
  - For each O (with 2 lone pairs + 1 double bond): NVE = 6; NNB = 4; NB = 4 →  
    ```  
    QF(O) = 6 – 4 – (4/2) = 6 – 4 – 2 = 0  
    ```

- **When FC ≠ OS**  
  - OS of O in CO₂ is –2 (assign all electrons in C=O to O), but FC = 0.  
  - **Remember**: FC emphasizes *electron distribution* in Lewis structures; OS tracks *electron transfer*.

---

**2. Term Symbols in Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy**  
*(Shorthand Notation for Quantum States)*

- **General Form**  
  ```  
  2S + 1  L  _J  
  ```  
  - **2S + 1** = Spin multiplicity (number of possible 2S+1 spin states)  
  - **L** = Total orbital angular momentum (encoded as letter: S, P, D, F, G, …)  
  - **J** = Total angular momentum (vector sum of L and S)

- **Components Explained**  
  - **S (Total Spin Quantum Number):**  
    - S = ½ × (number of unpaired electrons)  
    - Spin multiplicity = 2S+1.  
    - Ex: two unpaired electrons → S = 1 → 2S+1 = 3 → term is a “triplet.”

  - **L (Total Orbital Angular Momentum):**  
    - L = ∑ m<sub>ℓ</sub> over all electrons in partially-filled shells.  
    - Convert L to letter:  
      - L = 0 → S  
      - L = 1 → P  
      - L = 2 → D  
      - L = 3 → F  
      - L = 4 → G, etc.

  - **J (Total Angular Momentum):**  
    - J can take values: |L + S|, |L + S − 1|, …, |L − S|.  
    - Each J corresponds to a sub-level (fine structure).

- **How to Assign a Term Symbol (Example for Carbon Atom, 1s²2s²2p²)**  
  1. **Count unpaired electrons in 2p²** → two electrons occupy separate p orbitals with parallel spins: S = 1 (triplet).  
  2. **Possible m<sub>ℓ</sub> combinations** → best is maximize L = 1 (P term).  
  3. **Multiplicity** → 2S+1 = 3 → “³.”  
  4. **Possible J values** → L = 1, S = 1 → J = 2, 1, 0.  
  5. **Ground term** → lowest J for less than half-filled shell → ³P₀.

- **Example Term Symbol:**  
  ```  
  ³P₂  
  ```  
  means: triplet state (S=1), orbital P (L=1), J=2.

---

**3. Hybrid Orbital Shapes: Why One Lobe Is Larger**  
*(Understanding sp-Mixing & Orbital Overlap)*

- **Basic Idea of Hybridization:**  
  - Atomic orbitals (AOs) mix to form *hybrid orbitals* suited for bonding geometry.  
  - Ex: sp hybridization mixes 1 s AO + 1 p AO → two sp hybrids.

- **Constructive vs. Destructive Interference**  
  - **Constructive overlap** of s and p waves on one side → *large lobe* (increased electron density).  
  - **Destructive overlap** on the opposite side → *small lobe* (reduced electron density).

- **Mathematical Sketch**  
  - Hybrid functions:  
    ```  
    ψ_sp(+ ) =  c_s ψ_s + c_p ψ_p  
    ψ_sp(– ) =  c_s ψ_s – c_p ψ_p  
    ```  
  - The difference in sign for ψ_p in the second combination creates a node (near‐zero amplitude) on the small‐lobe side.

- **Why Is One Lobe Preferred in Bonding?**  
  - The *large lobe* directs more electron density toward the bonding partner → stronger, more directional bond.  
  - The *small lobe* remains non-bonding or interacts weakly.

- **Example: BeCl₂ (sp Hybridization)**  
  - Be central atom: ground state 1s²2s² → promotes an electron → 1s²2s¹2p¹ → sp mix → two sp hybrids.  
  - Each sp points toward a Cl atom at 180°, with large lobes overlapping Cl’s p orbitals.

---

**Summary**  
- Formal Charge helps choose Lewis structures; OS tracks redox.  
- Term Symbols compactly encode S, L, J for electronic states; used in spectroscopy.  
- Hybrid orbitals form by *constructive* and *destructive* mixing of AOs, yielding lobes of unequal size that optimize bonding.

**Study Notes: Determinants of Molecular Shape & Core Concepts of Valence Bond Theory**  

---

**1. What Determines the Shape of a Molecule?**  
- Molecules adopt the shape that  
  - Minimizes overall energy  
  - Maximizes bond strength  
  - Minimizes inter-electron repulsions  
- Key factors:  
  - **Bond energy and stability**: stronger bonds lower the molecule’s energy  
  - **Electron–electron repulsions**: shapes arrange electrons as far apart as possible  

**2. Shape → Hybridization (Not the Reverse!)**  
- The steps in determining geometry:  
  1. Identify regions of electron density (bonding pairs, lone pairs).  
  2. Determine the shape that minimizes repulsions (VSEPR principle).  
  3. Deduce the required hybrid orbitals to support that geometry.  
- **Important**: You don’t pick a hybridization then force a shape onto the molecule. Instead, the molecule’s most stable shape **dictates** which hybrid orbitals must form.  

**3. Core Concepts of Valence Bond Theory (VBT)**  
- **Postulate**: A covalent bond forms when two half-filled atomic orbitals overlap to give a region of high electron density between nuclei.  
- **Assumptions**:  
  - Only valence atomic orbitals participate.  
  - Atomic orbitals mix (hybridize) to form new equivalent orbitals.  
  - Hybrid orbitals must be similar in energy (ideally same principal quantum number).  
- Hybridization arises because the molecule “chooses” an orbital set that best overlaps and lowers energy.  

**4. Atomic Orbitals for Hybridization**  
- **Similar energy requirement**:  
  - Usually from the same shell (same principal quantum number, n).  
  - Occasionally from adjacent shells (e.g., mixing 2s and 2p, or 2p and 3d in transition metals).  
- **Result**: A set of equivalent hybrid orbitals oriented to minimize electron repulsions.  

**5. Overlap & Bond Strength**  
- **Extent of overlap**  
  - Greater overlap ⇒ larger bonding electron density ⇒ stronger bond ⇒ higher bond energy.  
- **s-character effect**  
  - A hybrid orbital with more s-character (e.g., `sp`) is lower in energy and closer to the nucleus.  
  - Greater s-character ⇒ electrons held more tightly ⇒ stronger, shorter bonds.  

  Example:  
  - In acetylene (`C≡C`), each carbon is `sp`-hybridized (50% s-character).  
  - In ethene (`C=C`), each carbon is `sp2` (33% s-character).  
  - In ethane (`C–C`), each carbon is `sp3` (25% s-character).  
  ⇒ C–H bonds get weaker in the order: `sp` > `sp2` > `sp3`.  

**6. Repulsion & Molecular Stability**  
- Total molecular stability = (sum of bond energies) – (repulsion energies)  
- Minimizing electron–electron repulsions (bond–bond, bond–lone pair, lone pair–lone pair) pushes orbitals apart into specific geometries  

**7. Bond Energy vs. Overall Energy of a Molecule**  
- **Bond energy**: the energy required to break a particular bond homolytically  
- **Overall molecular energy**: sum of all bond energies plus repulsion terms and nuclear–nuclear repulsions  
- Don’t confuse a single bond’s strength with the molecule’s total potential energy  

---

**8. Case Study: Why is CH₄ Tetrahedral?**  
- Carbon in ground state: 1s² 2s² 2p² → only two unpaired electrons  
- To form four equivalent C–H bonds:  
  - Carbon hybridizes its valence orbitals: `2s + 3×2p → 4 sp³` hybrids  
  - These `sp³` orbitals orient in a tetrahedral geometry (109.5° apart) to minimize repulsions  
- Each hybrid overlaps a hydrogen 1s orbital, forming four equal, strong C–H bonds  

---

**9. Practice Questions & Answers**  

1. **Which of the following molecules has the strongest C–H bond?**  
   a) C₂H₆ (ethane, `sp³`)  
   b) CH₄ (methane, `sp³`)  
   c) C₂H₄ (ethylene, `sp²`)  
   d) C₂H₂ (acetylene, `sp`)  
   - Answer: **d) C₂H₂**  
     - Reason: In `sp`-hybridized C–H, the carbon orbital has 50% s-character, so the bond is shorter and stronger than in `sp²` (33%) or `sp³` (25%).  

2. **[Cr(H₂O)₆]²⁺ readily reduces [Cu(H₂O)₆]²⁺. What are the term symbols of Cr and Cu after the reaction?**  
   - Reaction: Cr²⁺ → Cr³⁺ + e⁻ ; Cu²⁺ + e⁻ → Cu⁺  
   - Cr³⁺ (d³) term symbol: `⁴F` (quartet, F-term)  
   - Cu⁺ (d¹⁰) term symbol: `¹S` (singlet, S-term)  

3. **What is the valency of C atom in ground state?**  
   - Ground state: 1s² 2s² 2p² → four valence orbitals after hybridization → **valency = 4**

**10. Introduction to Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT)**  
- **MOT Postulates & Assumptions**  
  - Atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals (MOs) that extend over the entire molecule  
  - Number of MOs formed = number of atomic orbitals combined  
  - Electrons fill MOs according to Aufbau, Pauli, Hund’s rules  
- **LCAO Method (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals)**  
  - MO = ∑ cᵢ · AOᵢ  
  - Constructive combinations yield bonding MOs; destructive yield antibonding MOs  
  - Coefficients cᵢ reflect the contribution of each AO to the MO  

---

By understanding these principles—shape determination, hybridization order, overlap, repulsions, and orbital mixing (VBT & MOT)—you’ll be well-equipped to predict geometries, bond strengths, and spectroscopic term symbols in inorganic and organic molecules.

**Constructing MO Diagrams**  
- **Step 1: Identify the Atomic Orbitals (AOs) Involved**  
  - List valence AOs on each atom (e.g., 2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z for second-row elements).  
  - Only AOs of similar energy and symmetry can combine effectively.

- **Step 2: Combine Atomic Orbitals to Form Molecular Orbitals (MOs)**  
  - In-phase overlap → **bonding MO** (lower energy).  
  - Out-of-phase overlap → **antibonding MO** (higher energy, often denoted with a “*”).

- **Step 3: Consider the Energy Ordering of MOs**  
  - For homonuclear diatomics (e.g., B₂, C₂, N₂ vs. O₂, F₂):  
    - **With s–p mixing (B₂–N₂):** σ(2p_z) lies above π(2p_x,y).  
    - **Without significant mixing (O₂–F₂):** π(2p_x,y) < σ(2p_z).

- **Step 4: Fill MOs with Electrons**  
  - Follow the **Aufbau principle**: fill lowest-energy MOs first.  
  - Observe **Hund’s rule** in degenerate MOs (e.g., two π* orbitals).

- **Step 5: Determine the Bond Order**  
  - Use the formula:  
    ```  
    bond order = (number of electrons in bonding MOs – number in antibonding MOs) / 2  
    ```  
  - A higher bond order means a stronger, shorter bond.

- **Step 6: Analyze the Magnetic and Electronic Properties**  
  - **Diamagnetic:** all electrons are paired.  
  - **Paramagnetic:** one or more unpaired electrons.

---

**Energy Ordering of MOs: Why the “Switching”?**  
- **s–p Mixing (σ2s/σ2p interaction):**  
  - Occurs when σ(2s) and σ(2p_z) are close in energy.  
  - Pushes σ(2p_z) upward and pulls σ(2s) downward.  
- **Dependence on Atomic Number:**  
  - Early diatomics (B₂, C₂, N₂): smaller ∆E between 2s and 2p → more mixing.  
  - Later diatomics (O₂, F₂): larger ∆E → less mixing → standard ordering.

Example:  
- For N₂: σ(2s) and σ*(2s) interact with σ(2p_z), causing σ(2p_z) to lie *above* π(2p_x,y).  
- For O₂: ∆E(2s–2p) is larger → no significant mixing → π(2p_x,y) < σ(2p_z).

---

**MO Diagram of Carbon Monoxide (CO)**  
- **AO Energies:** O(2p) orbitals are lower in energy than C(2p).  
- **Resulting MOs:**  
  - **Bonding MOs** are closer in character to oxygen AOs.  
  - **Antibonding MOs** are closer to carbon AOs (since carbon’s AOs are higher).  
- **Key Points:**  
  - **Electronegativity effect:** the more electronegative atom (O) stabilizes bonding MOs.  
  - **s–p Mixing present** but less pronounced than in homonuclear diatomics.  

---

**Calculating Bond Order and Magnetic Nature**  
- **General Bond Order Formula:**  
  ```  
  BO = (Nbonding – Nantibonding) / 2  
  ```  
- **Example without s–p Mixing:**  
  - B₂ (10 electrons): filling order → σ(2s), σ*(2s), π(2p), σ(2p)  
    - Nbonding = 6, Nantibonding = 4 → BO = (6–4)/2 = 1 → **paramagnetic** (2 unpaired in π).  
  - C₂ (12 electrons): same order  
    - Nbonding = 8, Nantibonding = 4 → BO = (8–4)/2 = 2 → **diamagnetic** (all paired).

---

**Spectrum of Chemical Bonding**  
- Bond character depends on electronegativity difference (∆χ):  
  - ∆χ ≈ 0 → pure **covalent**; shared electrons.  
  - ∆χ large → more **ionic**; electron transfer dominates.  
- Covalent energy is higher when ∆χ is negligible (strong sharing).

---

**Electronegativity Concepts**  
- **Why Electronegativity Matters:**  
  - Predicts molecular geometry (via bond polarity).  
  - Helps assign **formal charges** accurately.  
  - Correlates with observed bond energies, lengths, angles.  
- **Electronegativity vs. Electron Affinity:**  
  - **Electron affinity (EA):** energy change when an atom gains an electron.  
  - **Electronegativity (χ):** tendency of an atom in a molecule to attract shared electrons.

---

**Mulliken–Jaffe Electronegativity**  
- Defined as:  
  ```  
  χ_Mulliken = (Ionization Energy + Electron Affinity) / 2  
  ```  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Not a fixed atomic property; varies with environment.  
  - Derived from measurable EA and IE.  

---

**Effect of Hybridization on Electronegativity**  
- **sp, sp², sp³ Carbons:**  
  - sp-hybridized C (50% s-character) is more electronegative than sp³ (25% s-character).  
  - Higher s-character → electrons held closer to nucleus → higher χ.  
- **Implications:**  
  - Affects acidity/basicity (e.g., acidity of alkynes > alkenes > alkanes).  
  - Influences bond polarity and molecular reactivity.

---

These notes outline the systematic construction of MO diagrams, explain energy ordering variations, illustrate with CO, demonstrate bond order calculations for B₂ and C₂, and cover fundamental concepts of electronegativity—including its measurement and the effect of hybridization—providing a clear framework for studying advanced inorganic bonding.

**EN of an Atom Is Not Fixed!**  
An atom’s **electronegativity** (`EN`) is often taught as a single number (e.g. Pauling scale), but in reality it varies with chemical environment.  

- Factors influencing `EN`:  
  - **Substituents (Inductive/Resonance Effects)**  
    - Electron‐withdrawing groups (–F, –Cl, –NO₂) pull electron density away, **increasing** the central atom’s `EN`.  
    - Electron‐donating groups (–CH₃, –OCH₃) push electron density in, **decreasing** `EN`.  
    - Example: In CH₃Cl, carbon’s `EN` is lower than in CF₄, because Cl is less electron‐withdrawing than F.  

  - **Size and Polarizability**  
    - **Large, “soft,” polarizable atoms** (e.g. I, Te) can delocalize partial charge with little energy penalty → can act as stronger electron donors/acceptors.  
    - **Small, “hard,” non‐polarizable atoms** (e.g. O, F) hold charge tightly → `EN` and electron affinities (`EA`) can change rapidly with environment.  

  - **Formal Charge**  
    - A positive charge increases an atom’s tendency to attract electrons → **higher** effective `EN`.  
    - A negative charge pushes electrons away → **lower** effective `EN`.  
    - Fun fact: A **positively charged carbon** in a methyl cation (CH₃⁺) can have an effective `EN` approaching that of fluorine!  

- **Charge‐Capacity Effect**  
  - The ability of an atom to accommodate extra charge **without** large energy penalties.  
  - Rationalizes **HSAB Theory**:  
    - **Hard acids/bases**: low polarizability, small size, charge localized → prefer to bind each other.  
    - **Soft acids/bases**: high polarizability, large size, charge delocalized → prefer to bind each other.  

---

**Acidity and s-Character in Hybrid Orbitals**  
As the **s-character** in a hybrid orbital increases, the bonded atom becomes **more acidic** (i.e., its X–H bond is easier to deprotonate).  

- Hybridization vs s-character:  
  - `sp³` – 25% s-character  
  - `sp²` – 33% s-character  
  - `sp`  – 50% s-character  

- Why higher s-character → greater acidity?  
  - Electrons in an s orbital are held **closer** to the nucleus (lower energy, more stable).  
  - Anion formed after deprotonation (e.g. C⁻ in an alkyne) is stabilized by high s-character.  

- Examples:  
  - Acetylene (`HC≡CH`, `sp`): pKa ≈ 25  
  - Ethylene (`H₂C=CH₂`, `sp²`): pKa ≈ 44  
  - Ethane  (`H₃C–CH₃`, `sp³`): pKa ≈ 50  

- **Nitrogen analogues**:  
  - Ammonia (`NH₃`, `sp³`) vs imine (`R₂C=NH`, `sp²`) vs nitrile (`R–C≡N`, `sp`) show similar trends in acidity/basicity.  

---

**VSEPR Model (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion)**  
Predicts molecular geometry by minimizing repulsions between electron domains around a central atom.  

1. **Draw a valid Lewis structure** (e.g. `CO₂`).  
2. **Count electron domains** (bonding pairs + lone pairs) around the central atom.  
3. **Arrange domains** to minimize repulsion (far apart as possible).  
4. **Assign positions of multiple bonds** (double/triple count as one domain).  

**Ideal Geometries** (electron domains → electron‐pair geometry):  
- 2 → linear (180°)  
- 3 → trigonal planar (120°)  
- 4 → tetrahedral (109.5°)  
- 5 → trigonal bipyramidal (90° & 120°)  
- 6 → octahedral (90°)  

---

**Flaws in the σ-Only (Bond Pair) Approach**  
VSEPR often oversimplifies by considering only **σ–σ repulsions**. In reality, we must include:  
- **Lone Pair–Lone Pair (LP–LP)**  
- **Lone Pair–Bond Pair (LP–BP)**  
- **Bond Pair–Bond Pair (BP–BP)**  

Order of repulsion strength (qualitative):  
- LP–LP > LP–BP > BP–BP  

- **Why?**  
  - A lone pair occupies **more angular space** (no competing nucleus on the opposite side); it “pushes” more strongly.  
  - Lone pairs tend to reside in hybrid orbitals with **greater s-character** (closer to nucleus), but still occupy significant volume.  

---

**Why Are OF₂ and H₂O Bond Angles Almost the Same?**  

- **Water (H₂O)**: Bond angle ≈ 104.5°  
- **Oxygen difluoride (OF₂)**: Bond angle ≈ 102.4°  

Key points:  
- Both have **two** bonding pairs and **two** lone pairs on O → expected geometry ~tetrahedral domain → ~109.5°.  
- **Electronegativity of substituents** affects LP–BP repulsions:  
  - F is more electronegative than H → in OF₂, electron density is pulled toward F, **reducing** O–F bonding pair electron density.  
  - This **decreases** LP–BP repulsion on O, tending to **increase** the bond angle.  
- **Competing effect**: F has three lone pairs of its own, which pull electron density **away** from O via σ* interactions, slightly altering geometry.  
- Net result: **Opposing factors nearly cancel**, so OF₂ and H₂O bond angles differ by only ~2°.  

---

**PH₃, AsH₃, H₂S vs NH₃, H₂O**  

- **VSEPR prediction**: all `XH₃` or `XH₂` (with one or two lone pairs) should have bond angles slightly **less** than the ideal tetrahedral (109.5°).  
- **Observed angles**:  
  - NH₃: 107° (close to prediction)  
  - H₂O: 104.5°  
  - PH₃: 93.5°  
  - AsH₃: ~92.1°  
  - H₂S: 92.1°  

- **Explanation**:  
  - In heavier main‐group hydrides, the lone pair resides in an almost **pure s orbital** (minimal hybridization).  
  - Bond pairs occupy nearly **pure p orbitals** oriented at ~90°.  
  - The lone pair is **stereochemically inactive** (close to nucleus), so it exerts less angular “push” on bonding pairs → bond angle ~90°.  

---

**Summary of VSEPR Model**  
- Useful first approximation for molecular shapes.  
- Must account for all electron domains (σ, π, LP) and their relative repulsions.  
- Lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs → compress bond angles.  
- Electronegative substituents can modulate repulsion by altering electron density.  

---

**Fluxional Behavior in Molecules & Berry Pseudo-Rotation**  
- **Fluxional molecules**: species whose atoms/lone pairs interchange positions rapidly at room temperature, leading to time-averaged symmetry.  
- **Berry Pseudo-Rotation**: a mechanism by which trigonal bipyramidal molecules (e.g. `PF₅`, `PCl₅`) exchange **axial** and **equatorial** positions without passing through a high‐energy planar state.  
  - Transition state: a “twisted” square pyramid intermediate.  
  - Low activation barrier → rapid exchange on NMR timescale.  

Example: PF₅ at room temperature shows **one** 19F NMR signal (all F environments equivalent) because axial/equatorial F’s rapidly interchange.

**1. Bond Angles in Hydrides of Group 15 (N) and Group 16 (O) Elements**  
- **Statement:** “The bond angle of hydrides of N and O group elements down the group increases because of pure p-orbitals’ participation in bonding.”  
- **True or False?** False  

- **Explanation:**  
  - In NH₃, the nitrogen uses **sp³-hybrid orbitals**, giving a H–N–H angle ~107°.  
  - As we move down the group (PH₃, AsH₃, SbH₃), the central atom’s valence orbitals are more diffuse and less effectively hybridized.  
    - Phosphorus and beyond tend to use more **pure p-orbitals** (and little s-character) for bonding.  
  - **Result:** bond angles **decrease** down the group (< 93.5° for PH₃, ~91° for AsH₃) because less sp³ character → orbitals are more “p-like” (90° angle).  

- **Key Point:** More **pure p-orbital** character → bond angle approaches 90°, so angles **decrease** down the group, not increase.  

---

**2. Coordinate Covalent Compound: H₃O⁺**  
- **Statement:** “H₃O⁺ is a coordinate covalent compound.”  
- **True or False?** True  

- **Explanation:**  
  - In H₃O⁺, a water molecule **(H₂O)** donates a lone pair on O to bond with H⁺.  
  - Both electrons in the O–H bond originate from the oxygen atom → **coordinate (dative) bond**.  
  - **Example:** NH₃ + BF₃ → NH₃→BF₃ (ammonia borane) also exhibits coordinate bonding.  

---

**3. Bond Angle Comparison: NF₃ vs. NH₃**  
- **Statement:** “NF₃ has a wider bond angle than NH₃.”  
- **True or False?** False  

- **Explanation:**  
  - NH₃ angle ≈ 107°.  
  - NF₃ angle ≈ 102° (narrower) because:  
    - F is highly electronegative → pulls electron density away from N–F bonds.  
    - Lone pair on N experiences **less repulsion** against bonding pairs → bond pairs come closer → smaller angle.  

---

**4. Halide Substitution: Formation of Tetra-iodomethane**  
- **Reaction Sketch:**  
  - `CCl₄` + 4 I⁻  →  `CI₄` + 4 Cl⁻  
- **Product:** Tetra-iodomethane (`CI₄`)  
- **Mechanism Highlights:**  
  - Nucleophilic attack by I⁻ on the carbon center of `CCl₄`.  
  - Stepwise substitution of each Cl by I.  

---

**5. What Is Coordination Chemistry?**  
- **Definition:** Study of **complexes** formed by **metal ions** (central atoms) and **ligands** (electron-pair donors).  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Central metal oxidation state, coordination number, geometry.  
  - Ligand types: anionic, neutral, monodentate, polydentate.  
- **Example:** `[Fe(H₂O)₆]²⁺`, `[Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺`, EDTA complexes.  

---

**6. Coordinate (Dative) Covalent Bonding**  
- **Definition:** A bond in which **both electrons** of the shared pair come from the **same atom** (the donor).  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Represented by an arrow: `→`.  
  - Common in metal–ligand bonds, acid–base adducts (Lewis theory).  
- **Example:**  
  - `NH₃ → BF₃` (ammonia borane)  
  - H₂O → H⁺ → H₃O⁺  

---

**7. Diborane (B₂H₆): Is it Coordinate?**  
- **Reaction:** 2 BH₃ → B₂H₆  
- **Structure:**  
  - Two **3-center–2-electron (3c–2e)** bonds (bridging H atoms).  
  - Each bridge uses one H atom sharing two electrons between **two B atoms**.  
- **Coordinate Aspect:**  
  - The bridging bonds can be viewed as B atoms donating into a shared orbital that includes the H.  

---

**8. Valence Bond Theory (VBT) – Pauling’s Proposal**  
- **Core Ideas:**  
  - Central metal d-orbitals **hybridize** with s and p orbitals to match ligand arrangement.  
    - Octahedral: `d²sp³` or `sp³d²`  
    - Tetrahedral: `sp³` (d-orbitals non-hybrid)  
  - **High-spin vs. Low-spin** determined by ligand field strength vs. pairing energy (P).  
- **Example:**  
  - `[Fe(H₂O)₆]²⁺` (weak-field) → high-spin;  
  - `[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻` (strong-field) → low-spin.  

---

**9. Failures of VBT**  
- Cannot quantitatively predict:  
  - **Magnitude** of splitting (Δ)  
  - **Spectrochemical series** order  
  - **Colours**, magnetic moments accurately  

---

**10. Bethe’s Crystal Field Theory (CFT)**  
- **Assumptions:**  
  - Ligands are **point charges** (anions) or **dipoles** (neutral).  
  - Interaction with metal d-orbitals is **purely electrostatic**.  
  - **Free metal d-orbitals** are initially **degenerate**.  
- **Why d-orbitals Split?**  
  - Approach of ligands along certain axes → uneven repulsion on different d-orbitals.  

---

**11. d-Orbital Orientations & the Uniqueness of d<sub>z²</sub>**  
- d<sub>xy</sub>, d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub> lie **between axes**  
- d<sub>x²–y²</sub>, d<sub>z²</sub> lie **along axes**  
- **d<sub>z²</sub>** has a **“doughnut”** in the xy-plane and lobes along z – interacts differently with ligands along the z-axis.  

---

**12. Crystal Field Splitting**  
- **Octahedral (Oh) Field:**  
  - `t₂g` (d<sub>xy</sub>, d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub>) lower in energy  
  - `e_g` (d<sub>x²–y²</sub>, d<sub>z²</sub>) higher in energy  
  - Splitting = `Δ₀`  

- **Tetrahedral (Td) Field:**  
  - Reverse order: `e` (d<sub>x²–y²</sub>, d<sub>z²</sub>) lower  
  - `t₂` (d<sub>xy</sub>, d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub>) higher  
  - Splitting = `Δ_t ≈ (4/9) Δ₀`  

- **Why Splitting Occurs Despite No Net Energy Change?**  
  - Although total d-orbital energy remains constant, **unequal stabilization/destabilization** lowers overall repulsion energy.  

---

**13. Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE)**  
- **Definition:** Energy difference between electrons in the **split** field vs. a **spherical** field.  
- **Formula (Oh):**  
  `CFSE = (-0.4 Δ₀ × n_t₂g) + ( +0.6 Δ₀ × n_e_g ) + P`  
- **Formula (Td):**  
  `CFSE = (+0.4 Δ_t × n_e) + (-0.6 Δ_t × n_t₂) + P`  
  - *P* = pairing energy penalty if electrons pair in the same orbital.  
- **Interpretation:**  
  - More **negative** CFSE → greater stabilization → more stable complex.  

---

**14. Factors Affecting Δ (Splitting Energy)**  
- **Ligand Field Strength:**  
  - **Spectrochemical Series:** I⁻ < Br⁻ < Cl⁻ < F⁻ < OH⁻ < H₂O < NH₃ < en < CN⁻ < CO  
  - Strong-field ligands (CN⁻, CO) → large Δ → favor low-spin  
- **Oxidation State of Metal:**  
  - Higher oxidation → greater metal–ligand attraction → larger Δ  
- **Metal Identity & d-Electron Count**

**Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE)**

- In an octahedral crystal field, the five d-orbitals of a metal split into two sets:  
  - **t₂g** (three lower-energy orbitals) at –0.4 Δₒ each  
  - **e<sub>g</sub>** (two higher-energy orbitals) at +0.6 Δₒ each  
- **CFSE** is the net stabilization (or destabilization) arising when electrons occupy these split orbitals instead of a degenerate set.  
- We also must account for **pairing energy** (P) when electrons share the same orbital.

• Example 1: [Co(F)₆]³⁻ (Co³⁺ is d⁶, a **weak-field** case)  
  - Electron configuration in weak field: t₂g⁴ e<sub>g</sub>²  
  - CFSE calculation:  
    ```  
    CFSE = 4×(–0.4 Δₒ) + 2×(+0.6 Δₒ) + P  
         = –1.6 Δₒ + 1.2 Δₒ + P  
         = –0.4 Δₒ + P  
    ```  
  - Note: 1 Å⁻¹ (often denoted 1 Δₒ) ≈ 10 Dq in older notation.

• Example 2: [Co(CN)₆]³⁻ (Co³⁺ is d⁶, a **strong-field** case)  
  - Electron configuration in strong field: t₂g⁶ e<sub>g</sub>⁰ (all electrons paired in t₂g)  
  - CFSE calculation:  
    ```  
    CFSE = 6×(–0.4 Δₒ) + 0×(+0.6 Δₒ) + 3 P  
         = –2.4 Δₒ + 3 P  
    ```  
  - Here “3 P” arises because six electrons form three pairs.

**Bethe’s Crystal Field Theory**  
*Achievements and Limitations*

- **Achievements**  
  - Explained the **geometries** of coordination complexes (e.g., why octahedral or tetrahedral).  
  - Accounted for **optical spectra**: predicted the wavelengths (colors) of d–d transitions.  
  - Rationalized **magnetic properties**: number of unpaired electrons from splitting patterns.  
  - Gave insight into the **colors** of transition-metal complexes based on Δₒ magnitude.

- **Limitations**  
  - Assumes purely **ionic** metal–ligand bonds (no covalency).  
  - Does **not** include contributions from metal s- and p-orbitals.  
  - Ignores the **orbitals of ligands** (no ligand-field interactions beyond point charges).

---

**Jahn–Teller Distortion**  

- **Fundamental Principle**  
  - Any non-linear molecule in a **degenerate electronic state** will distort to remove that degeneracy and lower its energy.
  - Common in octahedral complexes when electron occupancy of e<sub>g</sub> or t₂g is uneven.

- **Why It Occurs**  
  - Unequal occupancy of degenerate orbitals (e.g., e<sub>g</sub>⁴ t₂gⁱ) leads to instability.  
  - Distorting the geometry (elongation or compression) splits the degenerate levels further, stabilizing the system.

- **Elongation vs. Compression**  
  - **Z-elongation** (axial bonds lengthen): lowers energy of d<sub>z²</sub>, raises energy of d<sub>x²–y²</sub>.  
  - **Z-compression** (axial bonds shorten): opposite effect.

- **Factors Determining Distortion**  
  - **Nature of ligand**: π-donor vs. π-acceptor influences overlap with metal d-orbitals.  
  - **Degree of orbital overlap**: stronger overlap → greater splitting upon distortion.

- **Which 3d²⁺ Cations Show Strong Jahn–Teller?**  
  - d⁹ (e.g., Cu²⁺): highly degenerate e<sub>g</sub>⁴ t₂g⁶ → strong distortion.  
  - d⁴ high-spin (e.g., Mn³⁺): e<sub>g</sub>¹ t₂g³ → distortion.  
  - Also noticeable in d¹, d², d⁷ high-spin, etc., but strongest in d⁹ and d⁴ high-spin.

---

**Splitting in a Square-Planar Field**  

- Removal of two ligands along the z-axis from an octahedron yields square-planar coordination.  
- Orbital energy order (highest to lowest):  
  1. d<sub>x²–y²</sub> (antibonding with four equatorial ligands)  
  2. d<sub>xy</sub>  
  3. d<sub>z²</sub>  
  4. d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub>  
- Leads to unique magnetic and spectroscopic properties in complexes like [Ni(CN)₄]²⁻.

---

**18-Electron Rule (Effective Atomic Number Rule)**

- **Statement**: Many stable organometallic complexes achieve a total of 18 valence electrons (like the noble‐gas configuration).  
- **Calculation**:  
  - Count all metal d-, s-, p-electrons plus electrons donated by ligands.  
  - Aim for 18 e⁻; deviations occur but stability often correlates with values near 18.  
- **Examples**  
  - Fe(CO)₅: Fe⁰ has 8 e⁻ + 5×2 e⁻ from CO = 18 e⁻  
  - Ni(CO)₄: Ni⁰ has 10 e⁻ + 4×2 e⁻ = 18 e⁻

---

**Supramolecular Interactions**  
*“Digging deep only on orbital interaction is NOT enough!”*

- Beyond covalent/ionic bonds, weak forces dictate assembly and function in solids, liquids, and biological systems.

- **Types of Supramolecular Bonds**  
  - **Hydrogen bonding**  
    - Strong directional interaction between X–H···Y (X,Y = electronegative atoms).  
  - **Cation–π interaction**  
    - Attraction between a cation and the face of an aromatic π‐system.  
  - **Dipole–dipole interaction**  
    - Electrostatic attraction between permanent dipoles of polar molecules.  
  - **π–π stacking (Tr–Tr interaction)**  
    - Overlap of aromatic rings in a staggered or face-to-face arrangement.  
  - **n–π* interaction**  
    - Lone pair (n) of one molecule interacts with π* antibonding orbital of another.  
  - **van der Waals (dispersion) forces**  
    - Weak, non‐directional attractions arising from instantaneous dipoles.

- **Why They Matter**  
  - Control **crystal packing**, **enzyme–substrate recognition**, **drug–receptor binding**, and **material properties**.  
  - Even though individually weak, collectively they can dominate structure and reactivity.

**1. Types of Hydrogen Bonding**  
- **Intermolecular H-Bonding**  
  - Occurs *between* two different molecules.  
  - Example: In liquid `H2O`, each molecule can form H-bonds with neighbors, creating a 3D network.  
- **Intramolecular H-Bonding**  
  - Occurs *within* the same molecule.  
  - Example: Salicylaldehyde (o-hydroxybenzaldehyde) forms a six-membered ring by an O–H⋯O=C bond.

---

**2. Importance of Hydrogen Bonding**  
Hydrogen bonding dramatically influences many macroscopic properties:  
- **Boiling and Melting Points**  
  - Stronger H-bonding → higher BP/MP than predicted by molecular weight alone.  
  - Example: `H2O` (BP 100 °C) vs. `H2S` (BP –60 °C).  
- **Solubility**  
  - Polar/ionic solutes dissolve readily in solvents capable of H-bonding.  
- **Viscosity**  
  - More H-bond sites → greater resistance to flow.  
  - Example: Glycerol (three –OH groups) is much more viscous than ethanol (one –OH).  
- **Structural Integrity**  
  - Biomolecules (proteins, DNA) rely on H-bonds for secondary/tertiary structure.

**3. Why Is `H2O` Liquid but `H2S` Gaseous?**  
- **Bond Polarity & Electronegativity**  
  - O–H bond is highly polar (O: 3.44 EN vs. H: 2.20) → strong partial charges.  
  - S–H bond is less polar (S: 2.58 EN vs. H: 2.20) → weak dipoles.  
- **Lone Pair (LP) Availability**  
  - Oxygen’s lone pairs are held closer to its small nucleus → strong H-bond acceptors.  
  - Sulfur’s LPs are more diffuse (larger atomic radius) → poor acceptors.  
- **Polarizability**  
  - S is more polarizable, but this mostly augments London forces, not specific H-bonds.  
- **Net Effect**  
  - `H2O` forms a cohesive H-bond network → liquid at 25 °C.  
  - `H2S` relies on weak van der Waals forces → gas at 25 °C.

**4. Boiling/Melting Point Trends in p-Block Hydrides**  
- **Group 15–17 Hydrides**  
  - Period 2 elements (N, O, F) can form strong H-bonds → anomalously high BPs.  
    - `NH3` BP –33 °C (vs. `PH3` BP –87 °C)  
    - `H2O` BP 100 °C (vs. `H2S` BP –60 °C)  
    - `HF` BP 19.5 °C (vs. `HCl` BP –85 °C)  
  - Period 3 and below (P, S, Cl) cannot –H–X⋯Y(=O,N,F) H-bond effectively → BPs rise gradually with molar mass (van der Waals forces).
- **Molecular Weight & Dispersion Forces**  
  - From period 2 down, increased mass → stronger London forces → smooth BP increase in non-H-bonding hydrides.

---

**5. Anomaly: Why Is BP(HF) < BP(H2O)?**  
- **Number of H-Bonding Sites**  
  - `H2O`: 2 donors (–OH) + 2 acceptors (lone pairs) → tetrahedral 3D network.  
  - `HF`: 1 donor + 3 acceptors, but chain‐like associations predominate (zigzag chains).  
- **Network Dimensionality**  
  - Water forms an extensive 3D network → very high BP (100 °C).  
  - HF forms 1D chains → weaker overall cohesion in bulk liquid.  
- **Molar Mass**  
  - `HF` (20 g mol⁻¹) vs. `H2O` (18 g mol⁻¹): similar mass but network effect dominates.

---

**6. H-Bonding and Solubility**  
- **“Like Dissolves Like”**  
  - Solvents with H-bonding sites (–OH, –NH, etc.) dissolve polar/ionic solutes via dipole–dipole and H-bond interactions.  
- **Water as the Universal Solvent**  
  - Extreme polarity + four H-bond sites → dissolves salts, sugars, amino acids, etc.  
  - Example:  
    - `NaCl` dissociates into Na⁺ and Cl⁻, each stabilized by H-bonds to water’s δ–H and δ–O.  
    - Glucose (–OH rich) forms H-bonds with water → high solubility (~1200 g L⁻¹ at 20 °C).

---

**7. H-Bonding: Viscosity & Surface Tension**  
- **Viscosity**  
  - Defined as resistance to flow.  
  - Increased H-bonding sites → higher internal cohesion → higher viscosity.  
  - Example Viscosities (20 °C):  
    - Water: ~1 mPa·s  
    - Ethanol: ~1.2 mPa·s  
    - Glycerol: ~1,200 mPa·s  
- **Surface Tension**  
  - Energy required to increase surface area.  
  - H-bond network at surface resists expansion → high surface tension.  
  - Example Surface Tensions (20 °C):  
    - Water: ~72 mN·m⁻¹  
    - Methanol: ~22 mN·m⁻¹  
    - Acetone (no H-bonds): ~23 mN·m⁻¹  
- **Linear Relationship**  
  - As the number of H-bond donors/acceptors per molecule increases, both viscosity and surface tension increase roughly linearly.
