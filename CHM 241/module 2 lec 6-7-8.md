**Ionic Compounds: Unique Features and Hierarchical Structures**  

- **Key Properties**  
  - **Electrical Conductivity**  
    - Pure ionic solids are **insulators**.  
    - When molten or dissolved in a polar solvent, they become **highly conductive**.  
    - *Fun Fact:* Conclusive proof of discrete ions in the solid state remains elusive—ions are inferred rather than directly observed.  
  - **High Melting Points**  
    - Result from **multidirectional electrostatic attractions** between cations and anions.  
    - Does **not** imply that an individual ionic bond is stronger than a covalent bond.  
      - Example: Diamond (covalent network) has an even higher melting point and hardness than typical ionic solids.  
  - **Hardness and Brittleness**  
    - **Hardness:** Multidirectional attractions hold ions rigidly in place.  
    - **Brittleness:** Apply stress that shifts an ion plane; like‐charged ions line up and **repel**, causing cleavage.  
  - **Solubility**  
    - Polar solvents weaken ionic attractions via their **dielectric constant (ε)**.  
      - ↑ ε → ↓ electrostatic attraction → easier solvation of ions.  
    - Explains why ionic salts dissolve readily in water but not in nonpolar solvents.

**Conditions for Forming Ionic Compounds**  

1. **Highly Reactive Metals**  
   - Typically from Groups IA (alkali), IIA (alkaline earth), and IIIA.  
   - Low ionization energies facilitate cation formation.  
2. **Highly Reactive Non-Metals**  
   - From Groups VIA (chalcogens) and VIIA (halogens).  
   - High electron affinities favor anion formation.  
3. **Energetics**  
   - The sum of ionization energies (IE) plus electron affinities (EA), lattice energy, and solvation energies should be **thermodynamically favorable**.  
   - Formation is not required to be exothermic in every case.  
4. **Common Exceptions**  
   - Complex ions can behave like “pseudo‐ionic” species, e.g.:  
     - `NH4+ [B(C6H5)4]–`  
     - `NH4+ [B(C2H5)4]–`

**Crystal Systems and Bravais Lattices**  

Seven crystal systems categorize how points (atoms, ions) repeat in 3D space:

1. **Cubic (Isometric)**  
   - a = b = c; α = β = γ = 90°  
   - High symmetry; e.g., NaCl, CsCl.  
2. **Tetragonal**  
   - a = b ≠ c; α = β = γ = 90°  
   - Elongated cube along one axis; e.g., white tin (β-Sn).  
3. **Orthorhombic**  
   - a ≠ b ≠ c; α = β = γ = 90°  
   - Three different edge lengths; e.g., olivine.  
4. **Hexagonal**  
   - a = b ≠ c; α = β = 90°, γ = 120°  
   - Six-fold symmetry in basal plane; e.g., graphite, ZnO.  
5. **Trigonal (Rhombohedral)**  
   - a = b = c; α = β = γ ≠ 90° (all equal)  
   - Similar to hexagonal family but with 3-fold axis; e.g., calcite.  
6. **Monoclinic**  
   - a ≠ b ≠ c; α = γ = 90°, β ≠ 90°  
   - One axis tilted; e.g., gypsum.  
7. **Triclinic**  
   - a ≠ b ≠ c; α ≠ β ≠ γ ≠ 90°  
   - Least symmetric; e.g., kyanite.  

**Visualizing via Cube Transformations**  
- Start with a cube (cubic).  
- Stretch → Tetragonal.  
- Stretch twice differently → Orthorhombic.  
- Tilt once → Monoclinic.  
- Tilt and stretch → Triclinic.  
- Join three cubes → Hexagonal prism.  
- Tilt elongated cube → Trigonal.

**Why Symmetry Matters in Solids**  

- Crystalline solids exhibit **periodic atomic arrangements**—a direct outcome of symmetry.  
- **Classification & Prediction:**  
  - Symmetry determines possible **X-ray diffraction patterns**.  
  - Influences **electrical**, **optical**, mechanical, and thermal properties.  
  - Governs **phase transitions** and the nature of **defects**.

**Point Groups: Symmetry Operations at a Point**  

- A **point group** is the collection of all symmetry operations that leave at least one point fixed (no translations).  
- **Types of Symmetry Operations:**  
  - `Cn` (Rotation axis): rotate by 360°/n about an axis.  
  - `σ` (Mirror planes): reflect across a plane—vertical (`σv`), horizontal (`σh`), or diagonal (`σd`).  
  - `i` (Inversion center): invert through a central point (x, y, z → –x, –y, –z).  
  - `Sn` (Improper rotation): rotation by 360°/n + reflection through a plane perpendicular to axis.  
- **Examples:**  
  - NaCl crystal belongs to point group `Oh` (m3m).  
  - Zinc blende (ZnS) belongs to `Td` (4̅3m).

---

**Detailed Symmetry Elements**  

- **Rotation Axis (`Cn`)**  
  - An imaginary line: rotation by 360°/n leaves the object indistinguishable.  
  - **Order (n):** number of times rotation maps onto itself in 360°.  
    - `C2` → 180° rotation; `C3` → 120° rotation.  
  - **Principal Axis:** highest‐order rotation axis, typically aligned with the z-axis.  

- **Mirror Planes (`σ`)**  
  - Reflection operation that swaps coordinates across a plane.  
  - **Horizontal (`σh`):** perpendicular to principal axis.  
  - **Vertical (`σv`):** contains the principal axis.  
  - **Diagonal (`σd`):** bisects the angle between two `σv` planes.

## **1. Mirror Planes (σ)**

- **Vertical Mirror Plane (σ_v)**
  - Definition: A plane that  
    - contains the principal rotation axis (Cₙ)  
    - splits the molecule such that reflection in this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.
  - Key Points:
    - Denoted as `σ_v`.
    - Always contains the highest-order axis (e.g., in C₂ᵥ, the 2-fold axis).
  - Example:
    - Water (H₂O):  
      - Principal axis: C₂ through O and bisecting H–O–H angle.  
      - Two σ_v planes:
        - One contains the two O–H bonds.
        - The other is perpendicular to that, bisecting the H–O–H angle.

- **Dihedral Mirror Plane (σ_d)**
  - Definition: A vertical plane that  
    - contains the principal axis (Cₙ)  
    - bisects the angle between two C₂ axes (when multiple C₂ axes are present).
  - Key Points:
    - Denoted as `σ_d`.
    - Common in high-symmetry groups (e.g., Dₙᵈ).
  - Example:
    - Benzene (D₆h):
      - Principal axis: C₆ through center, perpendicular to ring.
      - Six σ_d planes: each bisects opposite C–C bonds.

---

## **2. Inversion Centre (i)**

- **Definition**
  - A point at which any line drawn from it to an atom, when extended an equal distance beyond, reaches an identical atom.
  - Symbol: `i`
- **Inversion Operation (Ī)**
  - Transforms a point `(x, y, z)` → `(-x, -y, -z)`.
  - Every coordinate sign is reversed.
- **Key Features**
  - If a molecule has `i`, it is *centrosymmetric*.
  - Common in octahedral (Oh) and some diatomic molecules.
- **Examples**
  - Octahedral complex [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ (Oh): center of metal is inversion center.
  - 1,2-Dichloroethene (cis) does **not** have `i`; (trans) does.

---

## **3. Improper Rotation Axes (Sₙ)**

- **Definition**
  - Combination of:
    1. A proper rotation by `360°/n` about an axis.
    2. A reflection through a plane perpendicular to that axis.
  - Symbol: `Sₙ` (called *roto-reflection*).
- **Properties**
  - If you perform the rotation followed by the reflection, the molecule appears unchanged.
  - Not every `Sₙ` is unique:  
    - If an `S₂` operation always equals inversion (`i`), so “S₂” is equivalent to `i`.
- **Key Examples**
  - **Boron Trifluoride (BF₃)**
    - Point group: D₃h
    - Has an `S₃` axis:
      - Rotate by 120° (C₃), then reflect through plane ⟂ to that axis.  
  - **Staggered Ethane (C₂H₆)**
    - Point group: D₃d
    - Has an `S₆` axis:
      - Rotate by 60° (C₆), then reflect ⟂ to axis.
  - **Methane (CH₄)**
    - Point group: Tₙ (tetrahedral)
    - Contains `S₄` axes:
      - Each `S₄` combines a 90° rotation followed by reflection.

---

## **4. How to Assign the Point Group**

1. **Identify the Highest-Order Rotation Axis (Cₙ)**
   - Look for the largest n (e.g., C₃, C₄, C₆).
   - If none, molecule may be C₁ (only identity) or have only mirror/inversion.

2. **Check for Perpendicular C₂ Axes**
   - If present → Dₙ point group.
   - If absent → Cₙ point group.

3. **Look for Mirror Planes**
   - σ_h (horizontal, ⟂ to principal axis) → add subscript h.
   - σ_v or σ_d (vertical) → add subscript v or d, depending on whether they bisect or contain C₂ axes.

4. **Check for Inversion Centre (i)**
   - If yes → add subscript i (e.g., Cᵢ, Dₙₕ if also σ_h).

5. **Search for Improper Rotation Axes (Sₙ)**
   - Presence can modify the point group (e.g., S₆ → D₃d).
   - If only Sₙ (no Cₙ except identity), group is Sₙ.

6. **Finalize by Hierarchy**
   - If multiple labels apply, choose the one with highest symmetry:
     - Highest order axis > perpendicular C₂ > σ_h > σ_v/σ_d > i > Sₙ.

---

## **5. Quick Reference: Common Point Groups**

- **C₁**: only identity (E)  
- **Cᵢ**: E, i  
- **Cₛ**: E, σ  
- **C₂ᵥ**: E, C₂, 2·σ_v  
- **D₃h**: E, 2·C₃, 3·C₂, σ_h, 3·σ_v

**What Is a Space Group?**  
- A **space group** describes the full set of symmetry operations that leave a crystal’s three-dimensional pattern unchanged.  
- It answers the question: “How can I move, rotate, reflect or otherwise transform a unit cell so that the overall crystal looks identical?”  
- There are 230 distinct space groups in three dimensions, classified in the International Tables for Crystallography.  
- Key idea: every crystal structure can be described by one of these 230 groups, which encapsulates both its lattice type and its internal symmetry operations.

**Symmetry Operations Included in a Space Group**  
- **Translations**  
  - Pure shifts of the entire structure by integer multiples of the lattice vectors (a, b, c).  
  - Example: copying and pasting a tile across a floor without rotation or flip.  
- **Rotations**  
  - Turning the structure about an axis by 360°/n (n = 2, 3, 4, 6).  
  - Example: a 3-fold rotation (120°) around the c-axis in a hexagonal crystal.  
- **Reflections (Mirror Planes)**  
  - Flipping the structure across a plane, turning left-handed motifs into right-handed ones.  
  - Notation: `m`  
- **Inversions**  
  - Inverting all points through a central point (x,y,z) → (−x,−y,−z).  
  - Notation: `\bar{1}`  
- **Screw Axes**  
  - Combine a rotation with a parallel translation along the rotation axis.  
  - Notation: `n_m` (n-fold rotation + m/n translation)  
- **Glide Planes**  
  - Combine a reflection across a plane with a translation parallel to that plane.  
  - Types: `a`, `b`, `c`, `n` (diagonal), `d` (diamond glide)

---

## **Translation in Crystals**  
- **Analogy**: Think of a brick wall where each brick (unit cell) is repeated without any twisting or flipping.  
- **Unit Cell**  
  - The smallest repeat unit defined by three vectors: **a**, **b**, and **c**.  
  - Contains atoms or molecules in a specific arrangement.  
- **Lattice Translation**  
  - Operation: (x, y, z) → (x + u, y + v, z + w) where u, v, w are integers times the cell edges.  
  - Builds the infinite crystal by repeating the unit cell along the X, Y, Z directions.

**Example**  
- A simple cubic unit cell of NaCl:  
  - At (0,0,0) and (½,½,½).  
  - Translating by (1,0,0) moves you from one Na+ to the next along the a-axis.

---

## **Centering in Crystals**  
Placing additional lattice points inside or on faces of the unit cell to describe how units pack.  

- **P (Primitive)**  
  - Lattice points only at the eight corners of the cell.  
  - Analogy: just the wireframe of a cube.  
- **I (Body-Centered)**  
  - One lattice point at the center (½,½,½) plus corners.  
  - Analogy: a ball sitting in the middle of a box.  
- **F (Face-Centered)**  
  - One lattice point at the center of each face (½,½,0), etc., plus corners.  
  - Analogy: stickers on every face of a die.  
- **C (Base-Centered)**  
  - Points only on two opposite faces (e.g., top and bottom).  
  - Analogy: two sheets of paper glued to the top and bottom faces.  

**Examples in Materials**  
- **P**: α-Quartz (P3_121)  
- **I**: α-Iron at room temperature (Im3̄m)  
- **F**: NaCl (Fm3̄m)  
- **C**: Monoclinic C2/c (C-centered)

---

## **Screw Axes**  
- **Definition**  
  - A symmetry operation combining an n-fold rotation about an axis with a translation parallel to that axis by a fraction m/n of the unit-cell vector.  
  - Notation: `n_m`  
- **Mechanics**  
  - First rotate by 360°/n.  
  - Then translate by m/n of the cell edge along the axis.  
- **Common Examples**  
  - `2_1`: 180° rotation + ½ translation  
  - `3_1`: 120° rotation + ⅓ translation  
  - `4_3`: 90° rotation + ¾ translation  
- **Everyday Analogy**: A wood screw—twisting it in (rotation) while it moves deeper into the wood (translation).

---

## **Glide Planes**  
- **Definition**  
  - Combine a reflection across a plane with a translation by a fraction of a lattice vector **in that plane**.  
  - Notation: letters `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `d` indicate direction/type.  
- **Types**  
  - `a`, `b`, `c`: translation by ½ along the specified axis in the plane.  
  - `n`: diagonal translation (½ along two axes)  
  - `d`: “diamond” glide, special combination in diamond structures (¼ + ¼).  
- **Visual Analogy**: Mirror your footprint and then slide it along the ground.

---

## **Screw Axis vs. Glide Plane**  

• Feature  
  - Screw Axis: rotation + translation  
  - Glide Plane: mirror reflection + translation  

• Movement  
  - Screw Axis: along an **axis**  
  - Glide Plane: across a **plane**  

• Visual  
  - Screw Axis: turning a screw  
  - Glide Plane: mirrored footprints sliding  

• Effect on Crystal  
  - Screw Axis: creates **helical** arrangements  
  - Glide Plane: creates **layered** repeating patterns  

---

## **How to Read a Space Group Symbol**  
Format: `[Centering][Symmetry in Hermann–Mauguin notation]`  

- **P2₁/c**  
  - P = Primitive lattice  
  - 2₁ = two-fold screw axis along b  
  - c = glide plane perpendicular to b (translation along c)  
- **Fm3̄m**  
  - F = Face-centered cubic lattice  
  - m3̄m = mirror planes and three-fold inversion axes  
- **I4/mmm**  
  - I = Body-centered tetragonal  
  - 4/mmm = four-fold rotation plus multiple mirror planes  

**Why It Matters**  
- Determines atom positions, allowed reflections in X-ray diffraction, and physical properties tied to symmetry (optical activity, piezoelectricity).  
- Essential for solving crystal structures and predicting material behavior.

**Summary**  
1. A space group codifies *all* symmetry operations in 3D.

3. Centering modifies how unit cells pack (P, I, F, C).  
4. Screw axes (`nₘ`) and glide planes (a, b, c, n, d) introduce *combined* operations.  
5. Reading a space group symbol lets you reconstruct the crystal’s symmetry and lattice type.  

Use these notes to identify, classify, and work with crystal structures in inorganic chemistry and materials science.

**Decoding Space Groups: A Step-by-Step Guide**

**1. Identify the Lattice Type (Centering)**  
The very first letter in a space-group symbol tells you how the lattice is “boxed.”  
- P (Primitive):  
  - Only the eight corners of the unit cell host lattice points.  
- I (Body-centered):  
  - One extra lattice point at the center of the cell.  
- F (Face-centered):  
  - Extra lattice points on all six faces.  
- C (or A, B) (Base-centered):  
  - Extra points on only one pair of opposite faces (C = faces perpendicular to the c-axis, etc.).  
- R (Rhombohedral):  
  - A special hexagonal setting with lattice points at cell corners and one at the body center along the trigonal axis.  

**2. Interpret the Symmetry Part**  
After the centering letter come numbers, letters and symbols that describe internal symmetry operations.  
- Rotation axes: `2`, `3`, `4`, `6` (2-fold, 3-fold, etc.)  
- Mirror plane: `m`  
- Inversion center: a bar over the number or `\bar{1}`  
- Glide planes: `n, a, b, c, d` (mirror + translation by half a lattice vector)  
- Screw axes: `2_1, 3_1, 4_2` etc. (rotation + translation along the axis)  

**3. Combine Lattice + Symmetry = Crystal System**  
Once you know the centering and the symmetry operations, you can assign the crystal system and often identify example compounds.

Example 1: `Fm\bar{3}m` (Space Group No. 225)  
- F = Face-centered cubic lattice (FCC)  
- `\bar{3}m` = 3-fold inversion axis + mirror  
- Crystal system: Cubic  
- Examples: NaCl, CaF₂  

Example 2: `P2₁/c` (Space Group No. 14)  
- P = Primitive  
- `2₁` = 2-fold screw axis along b  
- `/c` = glide plane perpendicular to c  
- Crystal system: Monoclinic  

Example 3: `I4/mmm` (Space Group No. 139)  
- I = Body-centered tetragonal  
- `4` = 4-fold rotation axis  
- `mmm` = three mutually perpendicular mirror planes  
- Crystal system: Tetragonal  
- Example: Rutile (TiO₂)  

**Summary**  
- The first letter (P, I, F, C, R) defines the “box.”  
- The subsequent symbols tell you exactly how atoms repeat: rotations, mirrors, glides and screws.

  - Lattice: Primitive cubic  
  - CN: 8:8  
  - At room temperature CsBr, CsI also show this structure  
  - Other MX (M = Na → Rb) can be “forced” to adopt it under pressure

**3. A₂B Type (Anti-Fluorite)**  
- Reverse of fluorite:

  - Cations on F⁻ sites, anions on Ca²⁺ sites  
  - CNs swapped: cation CN = 4, anion CN = 8  

**4. AB₃ Type**  
- Example: AlCl₃  
  - Gas phase: dimer Al₂Cl₆  
  - Solid state: 2D layers  
  - Building block: [AlCl₆]³⁻ octahedra  

**5. A₂B₃ Type**  
- Example: Al₂O₃ (Corundum)  
  - Hexagonal close-packed O²⁻  
  - Al³⁺ occupy 2/3 of octahedral sites → [AlO₆] octahedra  
  - CN: Al³⁺ = 6, O²⁻ = 4

**Fe₂O₃ (Hematite) Structure**  
- **Chemical formula:** Fe₂O₃  
- **Crystal packing:**  
  - Hematite adopts a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) array of oxide ions (O²⁻).  
  - Iron(III) ions (Fe³⁺) occupy two-thirds of the octahedral holes.  
  - The basic building block is the `[FeO₆]` octahedron.  
- **Alternate polymorph:**  
  - Fe₂O₃ can also crystallize in the spinel structure (maghemite, γ-Fe₂O₃).  
  - Spinel form has a cubic close-packed arrangement of O²⁻ with Fe³⁺ in both tetrahedral and octahedral sites.  

---

**Recap Questions (Module II: Ionic Solids)**  
1. **Transforming the cubic cell:**  
   - Stretching one axis + tilting → crystal system becomes **monoclinic** (angles: α = γ = 90°, β ≠ 90°).  
2. **Trigonal system condition:**  
   - Two equal axes, one different: **a = b ≠ c**, with angles α = β = 90°, γ = 120°.  
3. **Principal rotation axis in SF₆:**  
   - SF₆ is octahedral (Oₕ point group) → principal axis is **C₄** (fourfold).  
4. **Example of improper rotational axis (Sₙ):**  
   - Molecules like CCl₄ have an **S₄** axis (rotation + reflection).  
5. **Screw axis 5₁ translation length:**  
   - Screw axis 5₁ translates by **1/5** of the unit cell along the axis per operation → 0.2 fraction.

**Lattice Energy: Definition & Importance**  
- **What is lattice energy?**  
  - The energy released when gaseous ions assemble into an ionic crystal:  
    ```  
    M⁺(g) + X⁻(g) → MX(s)  
    ```  
  - Measures the strength of ionic bonds; larger magnitude → more stable crystal.  
- **Simple electrostatic model:**  
  - Treats ions as point charges interacting via Coulomb’s law.  
  - Accuracy ~90%; real crystals require corrections (dispersion, zero-point, electron-cloud repulsion).  

---

**Born–Landé Treatment of Lattice Energy**  
1. **Electrostatic (Coulomb) attraction**  
   - For a pair M⁺ and X⁻ at distance *r*:  
     ```  
     E_C = – (Z⁺·Z⁻ e²) / (4πε₀ r)  
     ```  
     - *Z⁺*, *Z⁻*: ionic charges (multiples of electronic charge *e* = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C)  
     - Negative sign indicates attraction.  
   - In a crystal, each ion interacts with many neighbors:  
     - Nearby opposite charges → additional attraction  
     - Next-nearest like charges → repulsion  
     - Sum of geometric factors → **Madelung constant (A)**  
     ```  
     E_C(total) = – (A · Z⁺·Z⁻ e²) / (4πε₀ r₀)  
     ```  
     - *A* depends only on the lattice geometry (e.g., A = 1.74756 for NaCl).  

2. **Short-range repulsion**  
   - Ions have finite size; electron clouds repel at close distances.  
   - Modeled by a Born exponent *n* (experimentally determined) and constant *B*:  
     ```  
     E_R = + B / rⁿ  
     ```  
     - *n* typically ranges 5–12 (larger for “hard” ions).  
     - Ensures E_total → +∞ as r → 0, preventing collapse.

3. **Total lattice energy**  
   - Sum of attraction and repulsion for one ion pair (multiplied by Avogadro’s number N_A):  
     ```  
     U(r) = – (A·Z⁺·Z⁻ e² N_A) / (4πε₀ r)  +  (B N_A) / rⁿ  
     ```  
   - Plot of U(r) vs. r:  
     - At large r, U → 0 (ions far apart).  
     - At small r, repulsion dominates (U → +∞).  
     - Minimum at equilibrium separation r₀ where dU/dr = 0.

4. **Determining repulsion constant B**  
   - At equilibrium r = r₀, derivative dU/dr = 0 leads to:  
     ```  
     B = (A·Z⁺·Z⁻ e² / (4πε₀)) · (r₀ⁿ⁻¹ / n)  
     ```  
   - Substituting back gives the **Born–Landé equation** for lattice energy U₀:  
     ```  
     U₀ = – (A·Z⁺·Z⁻ e² N_A) / (4πε₀ r₀) · (1 – 1/n)  
     ```  
   - Key variables:  
     - *Z⁺*, *Z⁻*: ionic charges  
     - r₀: equilibrium internuclear distance (from experiment or sum of ionic radii)  
     - *A*: Madelung constant (geometry)  
     - *n*: Born exponent

**Example: NaCl Lattice Energy Calculation**  
- **Given data:**  
  - Z⁺ = +1 (Na⁺), Z⁻ = –1 (Cl⁻)  
  - r₀ = 2.814×10⁻¹⁰ m  
  - A (NaCl) = 1.74756  
  - n (typical for NaCl) ≈ 9  
- **Apply Born–Landé equation:**  
  ```  
  U₀ = – (A·|Z⁺·Z⁻| e² N_A) / (4πε₀ r₀) · (1 – 1/n)  
  ```  
  - Numerically yields U₀ ≈ –755 kJ·mol⁻¹  
  - Very close to experimental value (–770 kJ·mol⁻¹).  

---

**Key Takeaways**  
- Lattice energy quantifies the stability of ionic solids.  
- The Born–Landé model balances long-range Coulomb attraction and short-range repulsion.  
- Madelung constant encodes lattice geometry; Born exponent encodes ionic “hardness.”  
- This model typically achieves ≈90% accuracy; further corrections improve precision.

**1. Simplified Born–Landé Lattice Energy Equation**

- **Purpose**  
  Estimate the lattice energy (U₀) of an ionic crystal from fundamental constants and ionic parameters.

- **General Born–Landé Equation**  
  `U₀ = - (Nₐ · M · z⁺ · z⁻ · e²) / (4 · π · ε₀ · r₀) · (1 – 1/n)`  
  - Nₐ = Avogadro’s number  
  - M = Madelung constant (depends on crystal geometry)  
  - z⁺, z⁻ = cation and anion charges  
  - e = elementary charge  
  - ε₀ = vacuum permittivity  
  - r₀ = nearest‐neighbor distance  
  - n = Born exponent (empirical repulsion parameter)

- **Simplifications for Common Units**  
  - If r₀ is in picometers (pm):  
    `U₀ ≈ 1.39 × 10⁵ kJ·mol⁻¹ · (z⁺ · z⁻) / [r₀ · (1 – 1/n)]`  
  - If r₀ is in angstroms (Å):  
    `U₀ ≈ 332 kcal·mol⁻¹ · (z⁺ · z⁻) / [r₀ · (1 – 1/n)]`

- **Accuracy & Corrections**  
  - These forms give ≈98% accuracy for many salts.  
  - For extreme precision, add:  
    - Dispersion (van der Waals) forces  
    - Zero‐point energy corrections  

- **Example**: NaCl  
  - z⁺ = +1, z⁻ = –1, r₀ ≈ 282 pm, n ≈ 9  
  - `U₀ ≈ 1.39×10⁵ · 1 / [282 · (1 – 1/9)] ≈ –790 kJ·mol⁻¹`  
  - Matches the known lattice energy (∼–787 kJ·mol⁻¹).

**2. Hess’s Law & the Born–Haber Cycle**

- **Hess’s Law**  
  - “Total enthalpy change of a reaction is path‐independent.”  
  - If a reaction follows multiple steps, ΔH₁ = ΔH₂ + ΔH₃ = ΔH₄ + ΔH₅ + ΔH₆, etc.

- **First Law of Thermodynamics**  
  - “Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed.”

- **Combining Both: Born–Haber Cycle**  
  - Apply Hess’s Law to ionic solid formation:  
    1. Sublimation of metal (M(s) → M(g))  
    2. Dissociation of halogen (½ X₂(g) → X(g))  
    3. Ionization of M(g) → M⁺(g) + e⁻  
    4. Electron affinity X(g) + e⁻ → X⁻(g)  
    5. Formation of solid M⁺(g) + X⁻(g) → MX(s)  (lattice energy, U₀)  
  - Sum of these ΔH’s = ΔH°f (formation enthalpy of MX).

- **Definitions of Key ΔH Steps**  
  - Heat of atomization (ΔHₐ): M(s) → M(g)  
  - Heat of dissociation (ΔH_diss): X₂(g) → 2 X(g)  
  - Heat of sublimation: for metals turning directly to gas.

- **Why It Matters**  
  - Calculate ΔH°f of known & hypothetical ionic solids (∼98% accuracy).  
  - Explain why some salts don’t exist (positive overall ΔH°f).

---

**3. Application: Heat of Formation of NaCl**

- **Cycle Steps & Energies**  
  1. Na(s) → Na(g): ΔH₁ = +108 kJ·mol⁻¹  
  2. ½ Cl₂(g) → Cl(g): ΔH₂ = +122 kJ·mol⁻¹  
  3. Na(g) → Na⁺(g) + e⁻: IE₁ = +496 kJ·mol⁻¹  
  4. Cl(g) + e⁻ → Cl⁻(g): EA = –349 kJ·mol⁻¹  
  5. Na⁺ + Cl⁻ → NaCl(s): U₀ = –787 kJ·mol⁻¹  

- **Net Enthalpy**  
  ΔH°f(NaCl) = ΔH₁ + ΔH₂ + IE₁ + EA + U₀ ≈ –411 kJ·mol⁻¹  

- **Key Revelations**  
  - ΔH of atomization & sum of IE + EA are always endothermic (+).  
  - The large exothermic U₀ drives spontaneous crystal formation at RTP.

---

**4. Theoretical Determination of Electron Affinity (EA)**

- **Challenge**  
  - Measuring EA experimentally (especially for F) is difficult.

- **Born–Haber Solution**  
  - Rearrange cycle for known ΔH°f, ΔH sub, ΔH diss, IE, U₀ to solve for EA.  
  - Example: EA(F) derived ≈ –328 kJ·mol⁻¹ (close to experimental).

---

**5. Predicting Existence of Ionic Solids**

- **Hypothetical NaCl₂**  
  1. Na²⁺ would increase coulombic attraction → more negative U₀.  
  2. Assume r₀ ≈ same as NaCl; fluorite structure (A = 2.52).  
  3. Calculate U₀ ≈ –2180 kJ·mol⁻¹ (±10–20% error).  
  4. Total ΔH°f remains strongly positive (IE₂ huge).  
  ⚠️ NaCl₂ cannot exist because overall formation is endothermic.

- **Hypothetical CaF**  
  1. CaF₂ is known; try CaF with rock‐salt or KCl‐type lattice.  
  2. Assume r₀ ≈ KF → U₀ ≈ –795 kJ·mol⁻¹.  
  3. Yet, CaF decomposes: 2 CaF → Ca + CaF₂ (more stable).  
  ⇒ CaF is not isolable under standard conditions.

---

**6. Kapustinskii Approximation of U₀**

- **When Crystal Structure Unknown**  
  - Empirical relation between A, r₀, n, and formula of MX_pX_q.  
  - Kapustinskii equation:  
    `U₀ ≈ - (K · z⁺ · z⁻) / r₀ · [1 – d/r₀]`  
    - K and d are empirical constants.  
  - Provides reasonable U₀ and ΔH°f (±5%).

---

**7. Factors Affecting Crystal Structures**

- **Ionic Radii**  
  - Not fixed values; depend on:  
    - Coordination number (CN)  
    - Spin state (high vs. low)  
    - Oxidation state

- **Determination Methods**  
  - X‐ray diffraction (XRD) electron density maps.  
    - Electrons scatter X‐rays → map outlines ionic “electron contour.”  
    - Careful calibration needed.

- **Examples**  
  - Fe²⁺ (d⁶ high‐spin): 92 pm vs. Fe²⁺ (d⁶ low‐spin): 75 pm  
  - Fe³⁺ (d⁵ high‐spin): 78 pm vs. Fe³⁺ (d⁵ low‐spin): 69 pm  

- **Implications**  
  - Size mismatch influences coordination geometry, packing, and overall stability of ionic solids.

**Ionic Radii, Coordination Number & Atomic Packing**  
*Study Notes – Page 7*  

---

**1. Ionic Radius vs Coordination Number (CN)**  
- **Definition of Coordination Number (`CN`):**  
  - The number of nearest‐neighbour ions surrounding a given ion in a crystal lattice.  
- **Example: Radius of K⁺ in Different CN Environments**  
  - CN = 4 → radius = 113 pm  
  - CN = 6 → radius = 116 pm  
  - CN = 8 → radius = 132 pm  
  - CN = 12 → radius = 153 pm  
- **Why Does Radius Increase with CN?**  
  - More adjacent (like‐charged) ions ⇒ greater electrostatic repulsion ⇒ central ion “backs off” ⇒ apparent ionic radius grows.  

---

**2. Other Factors Affecting Ionic Radii**  
- **Across a Period (Left → Right):**  
  - For ions of the **same charge**, the ionic radius *generally* decreases smoothly.  
  - Cause: increasing nuclear charge pulls electrons closer.  
- **Main‐Group vs Transition Ions:**  
  - *Main‐group ions* show less smooth trends because their stable ionic charges can vary (e.g. Al³⁺, Si⁴⁺).  
  - *Transition‐metal ions* often have more consistent charges (e.g. Fe²⁺, Fe³⁺) but additional d‐electron effects can complicate size trends.  
- **Down a Group (Top → Bottom):**  
  - Ionic radii *increase* due to addition of electron shells, but the trend can be modulated by oxidation states.  

> **Note:** Determining accurate ionic radii is non‐trivial.  
> • Most published values come from **Born–Haber cycle calculations** and carry ~5–10 % uncertainty.  

---

**3. Hard‐Sphere Model & Packing Efficiency**  
- **Atoms/Ions as Rigid Spheres:**  
  - Useful idealization for metals, ionic solids, noble‐gas crystals.  
- **2D Analogy – Coins on a Table:**  
  - Single layer: hexagonal arrangement gives maximum packing (each coin touches six neighbours).  
- **Extending to 3D – Billiard Balls:**  
  - **First Layer:** hexagonally close‐packed.  
  - **Second Layer Options:**  
    - Sit in **tetrahedral holes** (red spots)  
    - Sit in the other set (blue spots)  
  - **Key Point:** Cannot mix red & blue holes in second layer (geometrically impossible).  
- **Third Layer Choices:**  
  - Repeat first layer ⇒ **Hexagonal Close Packing (hcp)**  
  - Offset to align with first layer ⇒ **Cubic Close Packing (ccp)** a.k.a. **Face‐Centred Cubic (fcc)**  

---

**4. Comparing hcp vs. ccp (fcc)**  
- **Packing Efficiency:**  
  - Both hcp and ccp achieve the *same* maximum packing fraction (~74 %).  
  - **Coordination Number** in both = 12 (each sphere touches 12 neighbours).  
- **Why Prefer ccp?**  
  - Higher symmetry of the cubic lattice  
  - Simplifies diffraction patterns & unit‐cell descriptions  

---

**5. Counting Atoms in the Unit Cell**  
- **General Formula:**  
  number of atoms per cell = (corner atoms) + (face‐centred atoms) + (interior atoms)  
- **ccp/fcc Example:**  
  - 8 corner atoms × (1/8 each) = 1  
  - 6 face‐centred atoms × (1/2 each) = 3  
  - 0 interior atoms = 0  
  - → **Total = 4 atoms per fcc cell**  
- **hcp Example:**  
  - 12 corner atoms × (1/6 each) = 2  
  - 2 face‐centred atoms × (1/2 each) = 1  
  - 3 interior atoms = 3  
  - → **Total = 6 atoms per hcp cell**  

---

**6. Real‐World Examples of hcp/ccp**  
- **Common hcp Metals:** Be, Mg, Zn, Cd  
- **Common ccp (fcc) Metals:** Al, Cu, Ag, Au  
- **Noble‐Gas Crystals (Ar, Kr, Xe):** also adopt ccp  
- **Alkaline‐Earth Metals:** most are hcp or ccp (Ba is an exception: bcc)  

---

**7. Ionic Solids & Preferred Packings**  
- **When Cation and Anion Radii Are Similar (r⁺ ≈ r⁻):**  
  - A 1:1 ionic ratio can mimic identical‐sphere packing → hexagonal close‐packing.  
- **Charge Alternation Constraint:**  
  - Adjacent **like charges** (e.g. two cations touching) is *unfavourable*  
  - **Best Arrangement:** Simple cubic lattice with alternating +/– ions  

**Example: CsCl Structure**  
- Cs⁺ and Cl⁻ radii are nearly equal → **CsCl** adopts the **simple cubic** (SC) motif:  
  - Cs⁺ at cube centre, Cl⁻ at corners (or vice versa)  
  - Each ion has CN = 8  

---

**8. Role of Radius Ratios**  
- **Radius Ratio Rule (`r⁺/r⁻`):** predicts which holes cations occupy in an anion framework:  
  - 0.225 < r⁺/r⁻ < 0.414 → tetrahedral sites (CN=4)  
  - 0.414 < r⁺/r⁻ < 0.732 → octahedral sites (CN=6)  
  - r⁺/r⁻ > 0.732 → cubic sites (CN=8)  

- **Large Anions Direct the Lattice:**  
  - Anion array → hcp or ccp packing  
  - Cations fill available holes based on size  

> These simple models help rationalize why different ionic crystals adopt diverse structures—yet accurate predictions often require full lattice‐energy calculations.

---


# 8

**Ionic Solid Packing Preferences**  
- In ionic crystals, **anions** (negatively charged ions) form the primary close‐packed lattice.  
  - They stack in either **hexagonal close‐packed (hcp)** or **cubic close‐packed (ccp/fcc)** arrays.  
  - To minimize electrostatic repulsion, anions “back off” slightly from ideal hard‐sphere contacts.  
- **Cations** (positively charged ions) occupy the interstitial holes created by the anion lattice.  
  - Which holes a cation chooses depends on its size relative to the anion and on the stacking sequence of the anions.  
  - Two main types of holes:  
    - **Octahedral (Oh) holes**: formed at the center of six anions.  
    - **Tetrahedral (Td) holes**: formed at the center of four anions.  

**Interstices in hcp vs. ccp**  
- In **ccp (fcc)**: each repeating unit has both Oh and Td holes in a 1:2 ratio (i.e., twice as many Td as Oh).  
  - Cations with moderate radius ratios often prefer **Oh holes** (CN = 6).  
- In **hcp**: the arrangement of holes is similar, but because of the different stacking (ABAB… vs. ABCABC…), some cations can only access **Td holes**.  
  - Example: **LiI**  
    - I– anions pack in hcp or ccp.  
    - Li+ ions are small and fit into interstices.  
    - In ccp I–, Li+ prefers **Oh holes**.  
    - In hcp I–, Li+ has no choice but to occupy **Td holes**.  

**Case Study: ZnS Polymorphs**  
- The sulfide anion (S²–, r = 156 pm) is large and can adopt either hcp or ccp arrangement.  
- Zn²+ is small enough to occupy both Td and Oh holes.  
  - In **hcp S²–**, Zn²+ occupies Td holes → **wurtzite** structure (CN = 4).  
  - In **ccp S²–**, Zn²+ occupies Td holes → **zinc blende** structure (CN = 4).  

**General Guidelines for Ionic Packing**  
- Neutral species or atoms of the same size → **hcp** or **ccp** gives highest packing efficiency.  
- Charged ions of the same size → **simple cubic** may be favored to balance Coulombic attractions.  
- Large anion + small cation → anion network directs packing (hcp/ccp) with cations in interstices.  
- **Covalency** and **polarization** can distort ideal ionic packings and shift preferences.  

---

**Radius Ratio Rule & Coordination Number (CN)**  
- The **radius ratio** `r+/r–` helps predict the preferred CN of a cation in an anion lattice:  

  1. **Octahedral hole (CN = 6)**  
     - Model a square face in ccp: edge = 2r–, diagonal = 2r–√2  
     - For perfect fit:  
       ```
       r– + r+ = r–√2 
       ⇒ r+/r– = √2 – 1 ≈ 0.414
       ```  
     - Rule: if `r+/r– > 0.414`, cation can achieve CN = 6.  

  2. **Tetrahedral hole (CN = 4)**  
     - Limiting ratio: **0.225**  
     - If `0.225 < r+/r– < 0.414`, Td holes (CN = 4) are preferred.  

  3. **Cubic hole (CN = 8)**  
     - Limiting ratio: **0.732**  
     - If `r+/r– > 0.732`, cation may occupy cubic holes (CN = 8).  

  4. **Cuboctahedral hole (CN = 12)**  
     - Limiting ratio: **> 1.00** (rare, requires very large cation).  

**Examples of Radius Ratio Applications**  
- **BeS**  
  - `r(Be²⁺)/r(S²–) = 0.35` → between 0.225 and 0.414  
  - Be²⁺ → CN = 4 (Td holes) → wurtzite‐type structure.  

- **NaCl**  
  - `r(Na⁺)/r(Cl⁻) = 0.69` → > 0.414 but < 0.732  
  - Na⁺ → CN = 6 (Oh holes) → rock‐salt (fcc) structure.  

- **CsCl**  
  - `r(Cs⁺)/r(Cl⁻) = 1.08` → > 0.732  
  - Cs⁺ → CN = 8 (cubic holes) → CsCl‐type (simple cubic) structure.  

---

**Trends in CN vs. Radius Ratio**  
- As cation size **decreases**, it cannot maintain high CN without overlap → **CN decreases**.  
- Some borderline cases adopt **multiple structures**:  
  - **ZnS** (`r(Zn²⁺)/r(S²–) = 0.435`)  
    - Slightly above 0.414.  
    - Both CN = 6 (Oh) and CN = 4 (Td) are energetically similar (< 1% difference) → yields both wurtzite and zinc blende.  

---

**Extension to AB₂ and A₂B Compounds**  
- **AB type**: single radius ratio decides both ions’ CN.  
- **AB₂ type** (e.g., SrF₂ – fluorite):  
  - Calculate `r(Sr²⁺)/r(F⁻) = 132/119 = 1.11` → Sr²⁺ CN = 8.  
  - Calculate `r(F⁻)/r(Sr²⁺) = 119/132 = 0.90` → F⁻ CN = 8.  
  - Stoichiometry requires twice as many F⁻ per Sr²⁺, so each F⁻ is bonded to only 4 Sr²⁺ (tetrahedral).  
  - Final: Sr²⁺ CN = 8; F⁻ CN = 4.  

- **A₂B type** (e.g., K₂O – antifluorite):  
  - `r(K⁺)/r(O²–) = 152/126 = 1.21` → K⁺ CN = 8.  
  - `r(O²–)/r(K⁺) = 126/152 = 0.83` → O²– CN = 6.  
  - Stoichiometry (2 K⁺ per O²–) forces O²– into sites surrounded by 6 K⁺; each K⁺ sees 4 O²–.  

---

These structured notes summarize how ionic radii, packing types, and interstitial sites determine the crystal structures of simple ionic solids. By applying the **radius ratio rule**, one can predict coordination numbers and stacking sequences in a wide variety of AB, AB₂, and A₂B compounds.

**Coordination Numbers in Ionic Crystals**

- **Definition of Coordination Number (CN)**  
  - The coordination number of an ion in a crystal is the number of nearest‐neighbor ions of opposite charge that surround it.  
  - It reflects how many electrostatic interactions each ion participates in.

- **Example: K₂O Structure**  
  - Formula: K₂O contains twice as many K⁺ as O²⁻ ions.  
  - If each O²⁻ were surrounded by 8 K⁺ (CN = 8), total K⁺ neighbors per O²⁻ = 8.  
  - But stoichiometry demands 2 K⁺ per O²⁻ overall, so one might naïvely predict CN = 16 for O²⁻.  
  - **Resolution by stoichiometry**:  
    - Total bonds counted on O²⁻ side = 16  
    - Each K⁺ can only bond to a limited number of O²⁻ (its own CN)  
    - Simplify so that CN(O²⁻) = 8 and CN(K⁺) = 4  
  - Visual models often use:  
    - Grey spheres = O²⁻  
    - Green spheres = K⁺  

---

**Stoichiometry Effects on Coordination Numbers**

- **Balancing Bonds**  
  - Total number of cation–anion contacts counted from cation side must equal that from anion side.  
  - If anion quantity is 1 and each anion has CNₐ, total “bonds” = CNₐ.  
  - If cation quantity is x and each cation has CN_c, total “bonds” = x·CN_c.  
  - For consistency:  
    ```
    CNₐ = x × CN_c
    ```

- **Simplifying Coordination Numbers**  
  - Divide both sides by greatest common factor if necessary.  
  - Ensures integer CN values that satisfy both geometry and stoichiometry.

---

**Radius Ratio Rule and Its Application**

- **Basic Principle**  
  - Ions are approximated as hard spheres.  
  - The ratio of cation radius (r₊) to anion radius (r₋) predicts the most stable coordination geometry.  
  - Common thresholds (approximate):  
    - 0.225–0.414 → CN = 4 (tetrahedral)  
    - 0.414–0.732 → CN = 6 (octahedral)  
    - > 0.732 → CN = 8 (cubic)

- **Key Equation**  
  ```  
  radius ratio = r₊ / r₋  
  ```

- **Utility**  
  - Quick, first‐order prediction of likely CN in simple ionic solids.  
  - Serves as a guideline for anticipating crystal structures (e.g., rock salt, zinc blende, cesium chloride types).

---

**Failures of the Radius Ratio Rule**

- **Why It Can Fail**  
  1. **Ions Are Not Perfect Hard Spheres**  
     - Larger anions are polarizable and diffuse rather than rigid.  
  2. **Cation Polarization**  
     - Small, highly charged cations can distort anion electron clouds → partial covalency.  
  3. **Covalent Bonding Character**  
     - Covalent bonds have directionality (specific bond angles), unlike isotropic electrostatic interactions in the hard‐sphere model.  
  4. **Lattice Energy vs. Directional Bonding**  
     - Sometimes lower coordination with stronger directional bonds is favored over higher coordination with purely ionic interactions.

---

**Examples of Radius Ratio Rule Failure**

1. **Zinc Sulfide (ZnS)**  
   - Measured radius ratio: `r(Zn²⁺)/r(S²⁻) ≈ 0.52` → predicts CN = 6 (octahedral).  
   - Actual structure: **Zinc blende** (sphalerite) with CN(Zn²⁺) = CN(S²⁻) = 4 (tetrahedral).  
   - Reason:  
     - Zn²⁺ strongly polarizes S²⁻ → significant covalent character.  
     - Tetrahedral arrangement maximizes directional overlap between Zn 4s/4p and S 3p orbitals.

2. **Mercury(II) Sulfide (HgS, cinnabar and metacinnabar forms)**  
   - Measured radius ratio: `r(Hg²⁺)/r(S²⁻) ≈ 0.68` → predicts CN = 6.  
   - Actual stable form: **Zinc blende‐type** (metacinnabar) with CN = 4.  
   - Even greater covalency than ZnS → directional bonding dominates over close packing.

---

**Why the Radius Ratio Rule Fails**

- **Polarizability of Anions**  
  - Larger anions (e.g., S²⁻, O²⁻) have diffuse electron clouds.  
  - Easily distorted by the electric field of a small cation → partial sharing of electrons.

- **Directional Covalent Bonds**  
  - Covalent interactions favor distinct bond angles (e.g., 109.5° in tetrahedra).  
  - Leads to lower CN but stronger individual bonds.

- **Energetic Trade‐Off**  
  - Octahedral coordination (CN = 6) maximizes electrostatic attractions but may incur steric/electronic strain.  
  - Tetrahedral coordination (CN = 4) sometimes yields lower overall lattice energy if bonds are stronger and directional.

---

**Conclusion: Utility and Limitations of the Radius Ratio Rule**

- **Imperfect Yet Invaluable**  
  - Despite its simplifications, the radius ratio rule remains the most accessible tool for a first assessment of likely coordination environments in ionic crystals.  

- **When to Apply Caution**  
  - Compounds with highly polarizing cations (small r₊, high charge).  
  - Anions with diffuse electron clouds.  
  - Systems where covalent bonding is significant.  

- **Study Tips**  
  - Always compare radius ratio predictions with known structures and experimental data.  
  - Be ready to invoke polarization and covalency when the rule fails.  
  - Use complementary concepts (Madelung constants, lattice energy calculations, orbital considerations) for deeper analysis.

## **1. Recap of Previous Lecture**

- **CaF (Calcium Monofluoride) Does Not Exist**  
  - Despite having a negative heat of formation (ΔH_f < 0), CaF is unstable.  
    - *Size mismatch:* Ca²⁺ is too large to fit into a NaCl-type lattice coordination and F⁻ is too small.  
    - *Comproportionation:*  
      - 2 CaF → Ca + CaF₂  
      - CaF disproportionates into metallic Ca and CaF₂.  

- **ZnS Structure vs. Radius-Ratio Prediction**  
  - Radius-ratio Zn²⁺/S²⁻ > 0.414 → expect octahedral sites (rock salt).  
  - In reality, Zn²⁺ occupies tetrahedral holes (zinc blende or wurtzite).  
    - *Reasons:*  
      - S²⁻ crystallizes in an hcp (hexagonal close-packed) lattice → wurtzite.  
      - Zn²⁺ has a high polarizing power → partial covalent character.  

- **Equal-Size Cation & Anion → NaCl-Type Packing**  
  - When cation and anion radii are similar:  
    - Alternating arrangement of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ → each ion 6-coordinate.  
    - Anions form the close-packed lattice; cations fill all octahedral holes.

---

## **2. Factors Affecting Crystal Structures**

- **Radius-Ratio Rule**  
  - Predicts coordination number (C.N.) based on r_cation/r_anion.  
  - *Absolute for purely ionic solids.*  

- **Covalent Character (Polarization)**  
  - Partial covalency can override radius-ratio predictions.  
  - Governed by **Fajan’s Rules** (see next section).  

---

## **3. When Do Ionic Bonds Acquire Covalency?**

> Remember **Fajan’s Rules**: small, highly charged cations & large, polarizable anions → more covalent character.

- **Key Conditions for Covalency**  
  - Electronegativity difference &lt; 1.0.  
  - Small cation radius & high positive charge.  
  - Large anion radius & high negative charge.  
  - High **ionic potential** of the cation.

---

## **4. Ionic Potential**

- Defined as:  
  ```
  ionic potential, φ = Z⁺ / r (charge per unit radius)
  ```  
- Higher φ → stronger polarizing ability → more covalent bonding.

- **Examples of Ionic Potential (φ)**  
  | Ion  | Charge Z⁺ | Radius r (pm) | φ = Z⁺/r |
  |------|-----------|---------------|----------|
  | Li⁺  | +1        | ~90           | ~11.1    |
  | Na⁺  | +1        | ~116          | ~8.6     |
  | Be²⁺ | +2        | ~31           | ~64.5    |
  | Mg²⁺ | +2        | ~72           | ~27.8    |
  | Al³⁺ | +3        | ~53           | ~56.6    |
  | B³⁺  | +3        | ~27           | ~111.1   |
  | Ca²⁺ | +2        | ~100          | ~20.0    |
  | Ga³⁺ | +3        | ~62           | ~48.4    |

- **Trend:**  
  - Across a period, smaller radius → higher φ → more covalent character in “ionic” compounds.

---

## **5. Ionic Potential Across the Periodic Table – Examples**

- **Li⁺ vs. Mg²⁺**  
  - Both form metal‐organic complexes (e.g., butyllithium & Grignard reagents).

- **Be²⁺ vs. Al³⁺**  
  - Both form polymeric halides with bridging halogens (BeCl₂: chains; AlCl₃: dimers/polymers).

- **B³⁺ vs. Si⁴⁺**  
  - Boranes (BₙHₘ) vs. silanes (SiₙHₘ) and their oxides show structural analogies.

- **C vs. P; O vs. Cl; N vs. S**  
  - Similar electronegativities → analogous oxyanions (e.g., CO₃²⁻ & PO₄³⁻) and halides.

> **Caveat:** Similar φ often leads to similar behavior, but electronic structure & shielding also matter.

---

## **6. Rare Opposite Case: Polarizable Cation & Hard Anion**

- **Why Rare?**  
  - Large cation tends to retain its electron cloud → low polarizability of the anion.  
  - Hard anion (small, high-charge) resists distortion.

- **Example:**  
  - SnCl₂ vs. SnCl₄  
    - Sn²⁺ is more polarizing than Sn⁴⁺ in Cl lattice → SnCl₂ shows higher covalent character.

---

## **7. Effect of Electronic Configuration & Shielding**

- **Case Study: Ca²⁺ vs. Hg²⁺**  
  - Radii nearly identical (114 pm vs. 116 pm), same charge → similar φ.  
  - **CaCl₂**  
    - High melting/boiling points → primarily ionic.  
  - **HgCl₂**  
    - Much lower melting point; ~40% covalent character.  
    - *Reason:* Poor shielding by filled 4f/5d orbitals in Hg → nucleus strongly polarizes Cl⁻.

- **Polymorphism in ZnS**  
  - ZnS exists in two forms:  
    - Wurtzite (hcp S²⁻ lattice)  
    - Zinc blende (ccp S²⁻ lattice)  
  - Polarization & lattice energy differences favor one form under given conditions.

---

## **8. Summary & Key Takeaways**

- The **radius-ratio rule** reliably predicts structures for *purely ionic* solids.  
- **Polarization** (partial covalency) often leads to exceptions:  
  - Predicted coordination → changed to satisfy covalent preferences.  
  - **Fajan’s Rules** quantify propensity for covalency.  
- **Ionic potential (φ)** is a powerful tool:  
  - High φ → small, highly charged cation → strong polarizing power → covalent character.  
- **Electronic configuration** and **shielding** further modulate polarization:  
  - Transition-metal cations with filled d/f shells can be exceptionally polarizing.  

---

*Study Questions:*  
1. Using Fajan’s rules, predict whether MgO or MgS has more covalent character.  
2. Explain why AlF₃ is more ionic than AlI₃, even though Al³⁺ has the same φ in both.  
3. Sketch and compare the coordination environments of ZnS in wurtzite vs. zinc blende.

**Page 2 Study Notes: Polarization, Solubility, Reactivity, X-Rays & Spinels**

---

**1. Effect of Polarization on Ionic Compounds**

- Ionic compounds are not purely electrostatic attractions between point charges.  
- **Polarization**: distortion of anion electron cloud by a cation.  
  - Depends on cation charge density (charge/size) and anion polarizability.  
  - **Higher cation charge** and **smaller radius** ⇒ stronger polarization ⇒ greater covalent character.  
  - **Reverse polarization** (anion polarizes cation) is nearly impossible (except SnCl₂).

- Polarization dramatically influences:  
  - Melting point (MPt)  
  - Boiling point (BPt)  
  - Solubility  

---

**2. Effect of Polarization on Solubility**

- **Silver halides** in water illustrate polarization vs. solubility:

  - AgF  
    - Small, highly polarizing F⁻ is well‐hydrated ⇒ **readily soluble**.  
  - AgCl  
    - Moderate polarization ⇒ **partially soluble**; solubility ↑ in NH₃ (forms [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺).  
  - AgBr  
    - Greater polarization & larger Br⁻ ⇒ **generally insoluble**, but dissolves weakly in NH₃.  
  - AgI  
    - Very large I⁻, strong polarization ⇒ **insoluble**, even with NH₃.

- **Key idea**: strong cation–anion polarization ⇒ lattice energy ↑ & hydration energy ↓ ⇒ solubility ↓.

---

**3. Hydration Enthalpy & Effective Ionic Radii**

- **Hydration enthalpy (ΔHₕ)**  
  - Heat released when an ion is solvated by water molecules (exothermic for cations).  
  - More negative ΔHₕ ⇒ stronger ion‐water interactions.

- **Effective ionic radius (rₑₓₓ)**  
  - Sum of ionic radius + 85 pm (approximate radius of O in H₂O).  
  - Reflects “size” of hydrated ion.

- **Connection to polarization**  
  - Ions with very negative ΔHₕ are strongly solvated ⇒ behave as “small, highly polarizing” species in solution ⇒ can polarize counter-ions more.

---

**4. Effect of Polarization on Bond Length**

- In a compound M–X, the bond length can be approximated by:  
  `d(M–X) ≈ r(Mⁿ⁺) + r(Xᵐ⁻)`  
- Stronger polarization (more covalent character) can shorten the bond relative to pure ionic model.

- **Example**: Bond lengths in AgX series decrease less predictably because polarization distorts the “pure ionic” radii sum.

---

**5. Effect of Polarization on Chemical Reactivity**

- **Decomposition of alkaline-earth carbonates** MCO₃ → MO + CO₂  
  - Heavy polarization of CO₃²⁻ by M²⁺ destabilizes the carbonate, lowering decomposition temperature.

- Decomposition temperatures (°C):  
  - BeCO₃: unstable at RT (extremely polarizing Be²⁺)  
  - MgCO₃: 350  
  - CaCO₃: 900  
  - SrCO₃: 1290  
  - BaCO₃: 1360  

- **Anomalies**: PbCO₃ and CdCO₃ decompose at ~350 °C despite ionic radii ≈ Ca²⁺.  
  - Reason: d-electron poor shielding ⇒ Pb²⁺/Cd²⁺ are highly polarizing ⇒ carbonate destabilization → lower T₆₀₀.

- **Takeaway**: increased covalent character (via polarization) often **destabilizes** “ionic” lattices, making them more reactive or easier to decompose.

---

**6. X-Ray Crystallography**

- **What is an X-ray?**  
  - Electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths (0.01–10 nm) comparable to interplanar spacings in crystals.

- **Historical milestone**  
  - 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen discovers X-rays:  
    - Not deflected by magnets; passed through paper and flesh but absorbed by bone/metal.  
    - First radiograph: his wife’s hand.

- **XRD (X-Ray Diffraction)**  
  - Non-destructive method to determine atomic arrangements.  
  - Based on **Bragg’s Law**:  
    `nλ = 2d sin θ`  
    - n: diffraction order  
    - λ: X-ray wavelength  
    - d: interplanar spacing  
    - θ: angle of incidence  

- **XRD Applications**  
  - Phase identification  
  - Lattice parameters & unit cell dimensions  
  - Crystallite size, strain, texture analysis  
  - Purity and orientation studies  

---

**7. Spinels & Perovskites**

- **Spinels (AB₂O₄)**  
  - Cubic close-packed O²⁻ lattice with A (²⁺) and B (³⁺) cations in tetrahedral (Td) and octahedral (Oh) sites.  
  - **Normal spinel**: A²⁺ in Td, B³⁺ in Oh.  
    - Example: MgAl₂O₄ (gemstone “spinel”)  
      - Mg²⁺ → Td, Al³⁺ → Oh  

  - **Inverse spinel**: half B³⁺ occupy Td, remaining B³⁺ & A²⁺ occupy Oh.  
    - Example: Fe₃O₄  
      - Fe³⁺: 50% in Td, 50% in Oh  
      - Fe²⁺: in Oh  

- **Site preference drivers**  
  - **Limiting radius ratio (LRR) rule**: fits of cation radius to site size.  
  - **Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE)**: d-electron energies in Td vs. Oh fields.  
  - The dominant factor (LRR or CFSE) dictates cation distribution and spinel type.

## **1. Spinel vs. Inverse Spinel Structures**

- **General Formula**  
  - Spinel: `AB₂O₄`  
  - A = divalent cation, B = trivalent cation  

- **Octahedral (Oh) vs. Tetrahedral (Td) Sites**  
  - The oxygen lattice provides both Oh and Td “holes.”  
  - Cation preference depends on:  
    - **Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE)**  
      - Example: `Fe²⁺` in an Oh field has CFSE = –4 Dq ⇒ favors Oh site.  
    - **Ionic Size**  
      - Larger ions preferentially occupy larger coordination sites.  
      - `Fe²⁺` is larger ⇒ prefers Oh.  
      - `Fe³⁺` is smaller ⇒ can fit into Td holes.

- **Normal vs. Inverse Spinel**  
  - **Normal Spinel**  
    - Divalent A²⁺ in Td, trivalent B³⁺ in Oh.  
  - **Inverse Spinel**  
    - One B³⁺ in Td, A²⁺ + remaining B³⁺ split between Oh.  
    - Structural formula: `(B³⁺)[A²⁺B³⁺]O₄`.

- **Common Examples**  
  - MnFe₂O₄, NiFe₂O₄, FeCo₂O₄ (often inverse)  
  - MnCo₂O₄, NiCo₂O₄ (mixed/inverted)  
  - Mn₃O₄ (tetragonal spinel)

## **2. Perovskite Structures (ABX₃)**

### **2.1 General Features**

- **Formula**: `ABX₃`  
  - A = larger cation (e.g., Sr²⁺, Ba²⁺, Cs⁺, CH₃NH₃⁺)  
  - B = smaller cation (e.g., Ti⁴⁺, Pb²⁺, Fe³⁺/Mo⁴⁺)  
  - X = anion, usually `O²⁻` or halide (Cl⁻/Br⁻/I⁻)

- **Ideal Cubic Perovskite**  
  - Lattice: cubic, space group *Pm–3m*.  
  - A-site cation: at cube corner, **12-coordinate**.  
  - B-site cation: at body center, **6-coordinate** (Oh octahedron).  
  - X anions: at face centers, link A and B octahedra by corner-sharing.

- **Coordination Numbers (CN)**  
  - CN(A) = 12  
  - CN(B) = 6  
  - CN(X) = 4

### **2.2 Visualizing the Unit Cell**

- A-cation sits at the center of the cubo-octahedral cavity.  
- B-cation is at the center of an `BX₆` octahedron.  
- Each `BX₆` octahedron shares corners with neighboring octahedra, forming a 3D network.  
- X anions on faces connect B centers to A cations.

---

## **3. Goldschmidt Tolerance Factor (t)**

- **Definition**:  
  `t = (r_A + r_X) / [√2  (r_B + r_X)]`  
- **Interpretation**:  
  - `t ≈ 1.0` ⇒ ideal cubic perovskite.  
  - `t < 1` or `t > 1` ⇒ distortions to tetragonal, orthorhombic, rhombohedral.

---

## **4. Types of Perovskites**

- **Oxide Perovskites** (`ABO₃`)  
  - Examples: `SrTiO₃`, `BaTiO₃`

  - Examples: `CsPbBr₃`, `CH₃NH₃PbI₃`  
- **Double Perovskites** (`A₂BB′X₆`)  
  - Example: `Sr₂FeMoO₆` (Fe³⁺/Mo⁴⁺ ordered on B-site)  
- **Distorted Perovskites**  
  - Same composition but lower symmetry due to tilting of BX₆ octahedra.

---

## **5. Oxide Perovskites (ABO₃)**

### **5.1 SrTiO₃**  
- A = Sr²⁺ at 12-coordination, B = Ti⁴⁺ in octahedral coordination.  
- Non-ferroelectric, remains cubic down to low T.

### **5.2 BaTiO₃: A Ferroelectric Example**

- **Phase Transitions**:  
  - T > 120 °C: cubic, **paraelectric** (Ti⁴⁺ centrally located).  
  - 5 °C < T < 120 °C: tetragonal, **ferroelectric** (Ti⁴⁺ displaces along c-axis).  
  - Further lowering: orthorhombic → rhombohedral phases.

- **Driving Forces**:  
  - High T: symmetric cubic lowers enthalpy.  
  - Low T: symmetry breaking (Ti off-center) lowers free energy and induces a permanent dipole.

---

  - Offers tunable bandgaps and excellent light-harvesting properties.

---

- **Key Properties**:  
  - **Quantum Confinement** ⇒ size-dependent energy levels.  
  - **Size-Tunable Emission**:  
    - Smaller QDs ⇒ larger bandgap ⇒ blue emission.

---

## **8. Double Perovskites (A₂BB′X₆)**

- **Example**: `Sr₂FeMoO₆`  
  - Fe³⁺ and Mo⁴⁺ occupy B sites in an ordered fashion.
